      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Hello, I'm new to WordPress, but the first thing I want to do seems to be a problem. I have read a discussion about it here: &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/106176?replies=7"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://wordpress.org/support/topic/106176?replies=7&lt;/a&gt; but there does not appear to be a solution as yet.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When a large file is uploaded via FTP it is not visible in the Upload Manager where you can click on the file and have a link to it created in the post entry. We are trying to publish our pastor's sermons and so the file sizes will be quite large and it does not appear that we can upload them through the normal Upload feature as the browser times out. I want the process to be as easy as possible for none techy people so the interface is great, but we have to be able to use it with our files!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Any way this could be fixed for the upcoming release?
&lt;/p&gt;

Instead, a more likely--and useful--situation is that I want to assign the "edit_video" capability in a way that doesn't map neatly to existing roles. So for example Bob who is an "author" can "edit_video," as well as Mary an "editor," but not other editors or authors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That's exactly how I change capabilities, and I find that very useful.

This error is for all plug ins not selected ones.  now all of my plug ins are updated now cause i had to deactivate them all in order to see what worked and what didnt (though i could have just done it one at a time.) and so i feel it would better serve the user if it was notated on each plugin when a new update was available just like when a new version of wordpress is made available.

&lt;p&gt;
How would you get around the following two problems?  Currently, if a plugin wants to add a capability to a role, say "cap_X", it degrades nicely when the plugin is no longer in use--i.e. having an unused capability doesn't hurt anything. However, under the proposed system one would have to create a new role for each new combination of capabilities.  If I add "cap_X" to all my administrators, then they will no longer each be an "administrator"; they will be something plugin-specific.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You don't add cap_X to your administrators, you add it to the administrator role, and all of your users with that role get that capability because it is contained in the role they're using.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First, it's not clear to me what you're proposing.  Ryan says above that "If you want to change what a user can do, give the user a new role with a new set of capabilities."  That sounds to me like you can't change a role's existing capabilities; instead, you have to create a new role with its own capabilities.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Second, even if the proposed system does allow one to add capabilities to roles, that seems of trivial use. Let's say my plugin checks for its "edit_video" capability.  If I can add that capability only on a per-role basis, what's the point?  Instead of adding "edit_video" to all "editors," I should just check whether someone is an "editor."  The particular capability has become superfluous.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Instead, a more likely--and useful--situation is that I want to assign the "edit_video" capability in a way that doesn't map neatly to existing roles. So for example Bob who is an "author" can "edit_video," as well as Mary an "editor," but not other editors or authors.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Why not just drop roles entirely, and list capabilities on separate usermeta rows?  Then if you want to find out who can edit posts or whatever, it's a simple query.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Because then you lose the ability to modify roles and have all people using that role get the modification.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We could get around that by making roles into capabilities; then adding a capability to users who can "administrate" would be as simple as 1. changing the default caps for administrators (for future new users) and 2. adding the capability to all users who currently can administrate.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Besides, we don't really use roles that much, at least in core WP. Grepping through 2.3 I don't see anywhere that we check for users having the role of 'administrator' or 'editor.'  Rather, we check capabilities.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The second problem is getting two different plugins that add capabilities to work together.  One wants to give a user "cap_X," and the other wants to give the same user "cap_Y", so which gets to define the role?  It seems to me that in some fairly common scenarios the number of distinct roles could approach the number of users.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If each user has a distinct role, then yeah, you'll have a user:role ratio of 1.  That's not the common case in multi-user installs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Right--what I'm saying is that if users can have only one role, then that's the kind of situation you could end up with.  If I want Bob to "edit_video" and have all the other capabilities of an author, but I don't want other authors to have the "edit_video" cap, then I'll have to create a new role with author capabilities + the "edit_video" capability, and assign it to Bob.  Then if another plugin wants to assign, say, the "make_podcast" capability without giving it to everyone within an existing role, that plugin will have to generate a new role. It seems like the following would be some of the consequences to this arrangement:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Plugins clutter up the system with new roles for what would otherwise be slight changes (adding a capability).
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Roles become meaningless.  I can't assume that Bob is an author anymore, as he might have become the new role that combines the capabilities of an author with "edit_video."  So it does no good to test someone's role.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Plugins' different roles collide.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

It is probably best to preserve the ability to just include install-helper.php and let it get you wp-config.php
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Therefore a &lt;code&gt;dirname(dirname(__FILE__)).'/wp.config.php'&lt;/code&gt; is probably best
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Moving to 2.4 as 2.3.1 has gone RC

The reason arbitrary capabilities have been a flop is that there is no built-in method for modifying roles.  The plugin has to make assumptions -- assuming that the default roles exist and that they haven't been severly modified such that its assumptions are incorrect.  I'm not sure there's a good solution to that  besides having a simple built-in method of assigning these new capabilities to roles.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Why not just drop roles entirely, and list capabilities on separate usermeta rows?  Then if you want to find out who can edit posts or whatever, it's a simple query.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Likewise, it's a simple query to see what capabilities a user has on a given site.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Replying to &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5255#comment:5" title="Comment 5"&gt;ryan&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To get all users with a given capability, lookup which roles have that capability and fetch users with those roles.  Simpler code and queries, and also simpler conceptually.  What can this user do?  Look at his role definition. He can do only what his role allows.  This is pretty much what we do at wordpress.com to handle the many users there.  Multiple role and capability assignments get unmanageable pretty quickly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
How would you get around the following two problems?  Currently, if a plugin wants to add a capability to a role, say "cap_X", it degrades nicely when the plugin is no longer in use--i.e. having an unused capability doesn't hurt anything. However, under the proposed system one would have to create a new role for each new combination of capabilities.  If I add "cap_X" to all my administrators, then they will no longer each be an "administrator"; they will be something plugin-specific.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The first problem occurs if you de-activate the plugin: poof! all the administrators lose *all* of their capabilities, as their plugin-specific role no longer means anything.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The second problem is getting two different plugins that add capabilities to work together.  One wants to give a user "cap_X," and the other wants to give the same user "cap_Y", so which gets to define the role?  It seems to me that in some fairly common scenarios the number of distinct roles could approach the number of users.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #5257 (Pages Must Be Saved Before Adding Custom Fields) created</title>
      
        <dc:creator>hughbiquitous</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Thu, 25 Oct 2007 13:08:22 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5257</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5257/1193317702000000</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
If you add a custom field to an unsaved page, publishing the page turns it into a &lt;strong&gt;draft post&lt;/strong&gt; and data is lost.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Environment:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;At 2.3.1-RC1, SVN version 6280 (&lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress/branches/2.3"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress/branches/2.3&lt;/a&gt;)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Repro Steps:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create a new page.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Title it "Custom Field Bug".
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enter some text into the Page Content area.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create a custom field (I used key="file", value="foo bar baz"). Click "Add Custom Field".
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Click Publish.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Expected Result:&lt;/strong&gt; Page should publish.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Observed Result:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;After you click publish, it navigates to "Manage-&amp;gt;Pages" menu but the page is not there.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Click on "Manage-&amp;gt;Posts" and you will see a new, unpublished &lt;strong&gt;post&lt;/strong&gt; (not &lt;strong&gt;page&lt;/strong&gt;) that
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;(A) &lt;strong&gt;does&lt;/strong&gt; have the custom field, and
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(B) does &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; have the Post Content entered in step 3, and
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(C) does &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; have the title "Custom Field Bug" from step 2 -- instead, the title is "Draft created on (date &amp;amp; time)".
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; I could not reproduce this for a post. It only happens for pages.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Workaround:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create a new page.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Title it "Custom Field Bug Workaround".
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Click "Save and continue editing".&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create a custom field (I used key="file", value="foo bar baz"). Click "Add Custom Field".
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Click Publish.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This gives the expected result.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So your plugin file is being called directly rather than in a WordPress page load?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The attached patch can't work if you haven't already got ABSPATH defined and that is &lt;span class="underline"&gt;normally&lt;/span&gt; defined in wp-config.php - ideally we should say that including install-helper.php requires you to have already pulled in wp-config.php and then we could remove the require_once at the top and resolve this issue that way.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My plugin (Subscribe2) has changed over time and I've added a colum to the table created. To make sure this doesn't cause problems when users upgrade I have an upgrade function added to the shutdown hook. This upgrade function needs to use maybe_create_table and maybe_add_column. That is how the call is made.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The patch does work - I've tested it! However, if wp-config.php is not really required by install-helper.php then removing it should also fix my issue.
&lt;/p&gt;

Using v2.3, line 871 should be:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$where = " AND $wpdb-&amp;gt;posts.ID = " . $q&lt;a class="missing wiki"&gt;p?&lt;/a&gt;;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
and line 876 should be:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$where = " AND $wpdb-&amp;gt;posts.ID = " . $q&lt;a class="missing wiki"&gt;page_id?&lt;/a&gt;;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Background: My plugin uses the posts_where and post_join filters. When you join with another table that also has an ID column the query will fail, because above lines currently show: ' AND ID = '
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Agreed, I had to overcome a similar limitation while developing a patch. One of the problems perhaps is that every millisecond adds up when you need to have calls totaling over 3000 times. I'm unsure what the total is WordPress, but in which case the upper limit before things start running really slow (1-3 seconds) is around 4000 to 6000 times.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The problem is that in most cases when you do Object Oriented code, you'll want to do the time consuming tests once and before the hook is added. That way, you can just focus on calling what you need without doing the checks in the call method.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I've done some prototyping with this (all complete crap). I was thinking about it. That the code would be a really good candidate for a PHP extension. The code is simple enough, that it wouldn't take more than a few days to write, test, and deploy. The only problem is that you'll need something that everyone would have and not many would go through the effort to install a PECL extension.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'm not so much concern with the objects as I am with having to support PHP4 with such an object. I'll be unwilling to write OO code that has to be compatible with PHP4.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The patch is beautiful by the way. I really do think it should be accepted.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I wrote a few draft patches for this yesterday, and after reviewing those I came to two conclusions:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The filter/action code is time critical.  Anything that adds an extra function call, object dereference or similar can have a significant impact on performance.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol start="2"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Properly encapsulating the current_filter data requires a singleton object; a function with a static variable is messy and involves several branches and function calls (which affect performance).  Short of refactoring the filter/action API, I can't see a good way to overcome that.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;
wp-current-filter-revised-&lt;a class="changeset" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/6278" title="Add atom:self link to rss2 feeds per RSS Best Practices Profile. Fixes ..."&gt;r6278&lt;/a&gt;.patch is a compromise.  It uses only one global, and provides a current_filter() API function for fetching the filter or action name.  Only 2 lines of code are needed in each of the time critical functions, with no branching or user function calls.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #5255 (Simplify role/capability for easier cap =&gt; user lookups) updated</title>
      
        <dc:creator>ryan</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Thu, 25 Oct 2007 03:26:08 GMT</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
The current implementation has several faults.  Fetching all users with a given role or capability is painful. This is due mainly to how things are stored in arrays rather than rows in a table. Also, role definitions are stored per-blog in the options table rather than globally.  This creates pain for those doing multi-blog WP.  Finally, allowing multiple roles and caps per user is extra complexity for little gain.  It's a bunch of largely unused cruft.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Limiting users to one role instead of multiple roles and capabilities cleans up much of this.  A user has one role and that's it.  All capabilities come through it.  If you want to change what a user can do, give the user a new role with a new set of capabilities.  The user's assigned role would no longer be stored in usermeta as an array but as a single value.  This allows easy fetching of all users with a given role without having to parse array values out of a SELECT.  To get all users with a given capability, lookup which roles have that capability and fetch users with those roles.  Simpler code and queries, and also simpler conceptually.  What can this user do?  Look at his role definition. He can do only what his role allows.  This is pretty much what we do at wordpress.com to handle the many users there.  Multiple role and capability assignments get unmanageable pretty quickly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The next phase would be to rewrite the role storage to use the proposed sitemeta table so that we can fetch role definitions out of a proper table instead of out of an array stored in the options table. We could directly join on this, if desired, or we could continue doing the role cap lookup.  People would still have the option of foregoing storing the role definitions in the DB altogether, which is what many multi-blog WP and WPMU sites do.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We've had this redesign discussion several times since we created capabilities.  I think the time has come to fix this mess.  No one likes it as is.
&lt;/p&gt;

Silly me... when in doubt clear your cache.  Title's are the same, that fixes the security aspect.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As to best behavior, both I think are Ok, though I personally prefer the 404.  Otherwise there are a billion blank feeds available on the site.  404's don't need feeds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Pardon rushed appearance here... hand injury.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I presume that's for the trunk.  I've only got 2.3 running atm...
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;-              if ( $this-&amp;gt;is_comment_feed &amp;amp;&amp;amp; $this-&amp;gt;is_singular ) {
+                if ( $this-&amp;gt;is_comment_feed &amp;amp;&amp;amp; $this-&amp;gt;is_singular &amp;amp;&amp;amp; $this-&amp;gt;have_posts() ) {
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Not really fixing it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For example:
/private-post/feed/
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Title on feed reads: Comments on: ...
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For example
/invalid-post/feed/
Title on feed reads: Blog Name » 2007 » October » 14
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think throwing a 404 is 100% acceptable to be perfectly honest.  AFAIK most feed readers do know/understand the header.  Most are very http complaint (thanks to 301's and If-Modified-Since). Those that don't will either:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
a) do nothing (not so bad considering the situation).
b) find the feed invalid (not so bad considering there is no feed).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Plugin developers will likely revise the 'standard' Roles and Capabilities because WordPress Developers left open the future possibility of assigning a user to one or more Roles, or assigning Capabilities directly to a User.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
From &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://boren.nu/archives/2005/12/01/whats-new-in-20-roles-and-capabilities/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://boren.nu/archives/2005/12/01/whats-new-in-20-roles-and-capabilities/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Users can belong to one or more roles and can have individual capabilities assigned to them outside of the context of a role.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
It isn't that the feature is broken because of its perceived complexity (why would you want to simplify it otherwise?), it is broken because the API doesn't allow for one quick stop for adding capabilities.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Why would want to take away an excellent feature that would make WordPress worthy of being a CMS? It doesn't make sense. Just add a couple more functions that does the simplification for you. If you want to change the scheme, okay, just allow for what is currently available.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I would seriously have to reevaluate my position of using WordPress in the business environment if such a neat feature is dismissed.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
OK, here you go - 4642.4.diff.  I added the function get_user_by, which returns the ID, to pluggable.php.  (The svn diff command output is funky because of where it resynchronized.  Not sure how to make that look nicer.)  I modified get_userbylogin to call get_user_by, but I removed the caching in the process, because I don't know how to add caching to get_user_by.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
While it &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; remove some flexibility, I think it's worth it as it greatly simplifies the whole capabilities system and more in the spirit of the original feature's idea IMO.
&lt;/p&gt;

If I understand your description, this will break features that I use on my blog.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You'd still be able to do it, you'd just have to have a role with the permissions you want the user to have and then assign that user to that role. Possibly a role per user depending on how customized your roles are (i.e. if no two permissions are alike).
&lt;/p&gt;

If I understand your description, this will break features that I use on my blog.  I use the &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://redalt.com/Resources/Plugins/Role+Manager"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;Role Manager&lt;/a&gt; plugin to assign specific capabilities to certain users.  The plugin can also be used to remove capabilities from users.  You cannot see if a user has a particular capability just by looking up the roles.

We should drop:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;per-user capabilities
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;more than one role per user
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
With one user having one role, we can do cap =&amp;gt; user lookups by doing a query looking for users who have a role that contains that capability.
&lt;/p&gt;

Sp/k to Matt about this last week. We both agree that it would by interested to understand what infrastructure is needed to accomplish this, and to have it possible by the AtomPub protocol.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
AtomPub makes use of the same atom:updated element for this purpose.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The negative vote comes to having a field in the WordPress dashboard experience. How do you define minor? How does your audience? This seems like an experience to evolve on the consumption side based on the audiences definition not the publishers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The definition of minor can certainly vary by the author, and as already indicated, the consumer is always free to treat this as only a hint.  In any case, I can replace an entire paragraph, and deem the change minor, or change as little as one character and assert that the latter is significant.  All that is being asked for here is a checkbox (with associated help) and an if check.
&lt;/p&gt;

Bottom line for me is I unfortunately see it as generally an over engineered experience, and unnecessary cognitive burden. Great plugin material.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To be clear, the content would be updated -- this just affects the timestamp for the "updated" element.  It was also suggested that this would be a good use of inline documentation to help people understand what is minor (grammar, spelling, typos) and what is not (additions, deletions, alterations that change meaning).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Clients are free to implement content comparison to communicate changes to readers.  NetNewsWire Pro does this.

&lt;p&gt;
This is a really good idea.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ideally the minorness should be filterable so plugins can auto decide it too.

&lt;p&gt;
@Westi,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But I'm not including wp-config.php in my plugin - I'm accessing maybe_create_table. When I include either upgrade.php or install-helper.php THESE file call on wp-config'php using a relational path. As the original file executing is coming from the plugin folder (my script) the wp-config.php file is reported as not found.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
By defining the full path to wp-config.php as in the attached diff fixes this issue. If you can suggest another way for me to access maybe_create_table I'll be more than happy but I only 'require_once' one of the two files above as maybe_create_table is not defined (I check is with an if (exists()) statement).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So your plugin file is being called directly rather than in a WordPress page load?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The attached patch can't work if you haven't already got ABSPATH defined and that is &lt;span class="underline"&gt;normally&lt;/span&gt; defined in wp-config.php - ideally we should say that including install-helper.php requires you to have already pulled in wp-config.php and then we could remove the require_once at the top and resolve this issue that way.
&lt;/p&gt;

After uneasy research, I found that the origin is that &lt;br /&gt;
in &lt;strong&gt;get_term_field('description', $category, 'category')&lt;/strong&gt; the function sanitize_term_field() was called &lt;em&gt;one time too much&lt;/em&gt; : one by get_term and one for the field in the return...
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;function get_term_field( $field, $term, $taxonomy, $context = 'display' ) {

&lt;p&gt;
the patch worked for me on my pre-2.3 installs, but i can't get it to work on my 2.3 install; i'm positive i'm patching the right code, but i think there's something else in need of revision in 2.3.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
any ideas? is the 2.4 milestone definite? i'm pretty surprised this isn't more of an issue for folks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The 2.4 milestone is suggested not definite - if this issue is not resolved when it comes to releasing 2.4 then it will be bumped to 2.5
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think a better fix to this issue is to move all direct uses of fsockopen to a wrapped version which provides the proxy support (and possibly uses curl is fsockopen is disabled)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Then all places where we have duplicated fsockopen code can use this one route.
&lt;/p&gt;

When posting-by-email, my cellphone submits code using "content-transfer-encoding: base64". The message appears (output from wp-mail.php) like so:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Author = [my email] &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Content-type:&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt; text/plain, &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Content-Transfer-Encoding:&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt; base64, &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;boundary:&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Raw content:&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;SnVzdCB0ZXN0aW5nIHBvc3RpbmcgZnJvbSBteSBjZWxsLiBTdHJ1Y2sgbWUgd2hpbGUgcmVh

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The provided patch detects base64-encoded content transfers and base64_decodes them. For some reason (I'm no utf8-expert) the TITLE of the post has "=?utf-8?B?" prepended to the actual base64 content (see above), which means a check for this string + a cropping is needed or base64_decode will not decode the post title properly.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
hmmm, add_link()/edit_link() already did a cap check, so I think our patch didn't really change anything.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Agreed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I noticed those first when I went to look at branches/2.0
From what I can tell from reading through both the ajax and non-ajax routes you need a user with manage_links to achieve adding a link.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is beginning to feel like someone has either stolen then cookies from a high level user _or_ found a way to create a high level user - I can't see any vector for that from the code reviewing I have done.
&lt;/p&gt;

if anyone has infuence to bring this bug back in to the front, please do.
the bug does not allow the author to use blanc lines in his writings, which should be the writers own choice.
the effect is chown in Firefox on the Mac as well.
&lt;/p&gt;

Hmm.&lt;br /&gt;
Actually in that case something is wrong with my wp install. Maybe it is a bug after all.&lt;br /&gt;
I have completely flushed my browser cache, tried different freshly installed browsers, even tried different machines, which I never used to access my wp to see if the situation persists. It displays English text.&lt;br /&gt;
I can assure you that it is not my browser problem.&lt;br /&gt;
And if I switch &lt;code&gt;$val&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;__($val)&lt;/code&gt;, the result is consistent. &lt;code&gt;$val&lt;/code&gt; contains English text when foreach-echo is called, not L10n'ed text.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Probably some residue from 2.2.3? (I followed the official upgrading guide.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Another work around is just to add in some line breaks:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Some text!
		&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;

Are you still able to tell the difference between a private post and a 404 post with this patch?  Feed output looks the same, to me.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
First of all, my sincere apologies if this is a duplicate.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The problem, in short: WordPress inserted a number of unclosed &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags into my post. It should either insert correctly closed tags, or none at all. I honestly would prefer the former.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In detail: I had HTML code very similar to this:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;text&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;subtext&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;more text&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This was automatically converted to:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;text&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;subtext&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;more text&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Note the extra &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag in the above, which is unclosed (making the W3C validator choke on my website).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Also note, I was not using the WYSIWYG editor (turning it off was the first thing I did), so it's unlikely to be due to that.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As a workaround, manually inserting properly closed &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags works just fine:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;text&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;subtext&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;more text&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Since this workaround exists, the bug is not very prioritary, but it should also (hopefully) be easy to fix.
&lt;/p&gt;
