Self correction: "Include verbiage in" the new implementation of the default post/first time info. I think the changes that were reverted were a great start, it's just the implementation as the first default post was rather opaque.

Can you rephrase this ticket as a list of actual bugs - it is hard to investigate/fix without a list of actual issues.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'm afraid I cannot: I merely noted the issue while working on my caching plugin, I thought it looked very fishy, and so I opened a ticket in case anyone felt looking into it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
nacin did, checked that most potential issues were already covered indirectly, except the one that he mentions in his previous comment.

Jane, there's a significant difference:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If the link is set to open in the same window, you can make it open in a new window.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Whereas, if the link is set to open in a new window, you can't make it open in the same window.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Agreeing 100%. I really don't mind the behavior for the preview button. But please, please. Not the View Post link.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
There are two additional points to consider:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Matt has stated that he will re-open the retention of the info (in specific and in aggregate) w/Automattic's legal counsel "in January or February" (&lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://wpdevel.wordpress.com/2009/12/10/suggest-agenda-items-for-dec-17th-dev-ch/comment-page-1/#comment-4183"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;cite&lt;/a&gt;).
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After Thursday's IRC meetup, Westi reverted the new-for-2.9 default post to the old "Hello World" boilerplate in &lt;a class="changeset" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/12366" title="Revert [11212], [12252], [12255] and [12258]. Stick with Hello World ..."&gt;r12366&lt;/a&gt; as the implementation of Critical-First-Time-Info-As-Post was apparently confusing the tar out of newbies.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I'd like to suggest that, as a portion of the disclosure policy, we include verbiage in version 3.0+ that either explicitly spells out the policy or makes note of the URL on the .org and lets people know why it's important. Also, links to the disabling/anonymizing plugins in said new default post language or in the .org's privacy policy page.  In combination, I believe this would answer 99% of the objections currently held (including mine).
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Reposting a forum entry I penned over at WPTavern. Reposting it here for the "if it isn't in Trac, it doesn't exist" factor.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A common complaint from those in favor the the status quo is: what harm could there possibly be in storing your URL? Allow me to give two examples to illustrate potential for harm.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Military/Gov't Contractor blogging environment&lt;/strong&gt;
I don't know how many of you have worked for a military or US gov't contractor in the past, but one of their concerns when it comes to information disclosure is the revelation of employee names to third parties. Foreign intelligence officers (FIOs) from e.g. Syria, North Korea, China, Iran, etc. are always on the lookout for employee names/identifiable information so that they can potentially exploit that person as an intelligence asset, either via compromising their home (or work) machines with spear-phishing attacks or via direct physical surveillance. The vast majority of proprietary/classified information leaks come not through direct technological hacks/cracks but through social engineering and careful use of human factors (see Mitnick, et al.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the event that a contractor is using WordPress internal to the company and employing custom themes or plugins whose authors (as is a good practice in the WP community) have identified themselves, the .org site is potentially storing said information in a way directly tied to the company. If WordPress.org inadvertantly discloses the information in question, either through human error on their part or through a security breach by FIOs, you now have exploitable humint on discrete employees working for said contractors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If it was widely known, this fact alone is enough to make most contractors' IT departments ban WordPress outright. At the very least, they will disable update checking in its entirety. Neither of these situations is particularly a good thing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Political Dissident blogging environment&lt;/strong&gt;
I referred to FIOs above. For hostile/totalitarian regimes, FIOs generally serve two purposes: exploitation of information from gov't interests and observation/intimidation of political dissidents.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As in the gov't contractor example I gave above, if dissidents are using any custom themes or plugins, their information could be accidentally disclosed to FIOs which could either lead to direct physical danger for themselves (if they are living within the borders of an oppressive state) or, in the case of ex-pats with families that remain behind, danger for their families still under the sway of these states.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Or, say a plugin was written that made your stylesheet go green in support of the protestors in Iran. If WP.org's data was compromised, Iranian IOs would have access to a comprehensive list of folks running said plugin (and a list of everyone using the Farsi locale) and thus be able to narrow their intelligence-gathering and intimidation efforts based solely upon an installed plugin.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you think I'm being paranoid here, please see the recent examples of Egypt and Cuba jailing political bloggers and the Iranian intelligence services threatening expats (&lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125978649644673331.html?mod=WSJ_hpp_LEFTTopStories"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125978649644673331.html?mod=WSJ_hpp_LEFTTopStories&lt;/a&gt;)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
(I'm not even going to get into the area of compulsory legal disclosure of the info -- i.e., a third party brings suit or attempts to get law enforcement to retrieve .org's data based upon discovery or a warrant.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It's not "just" a URL in these situations, it's real people whose real lives stand to be substantively affected in the event of a disclosure, unintentional or otherwise.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
oh the issue is about limiting the amount of memory consumed while generating a sitemap xml file.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
basically, I query each and every last post, for only one purpose: to generate a permalink. not all fields are needed for this. in particular the excerpt and content, which are expensive to retrieve. so I add a filter to the posts fields, in order to stick to those that could be needed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I then update_post_cache() the mess so that get_permalink() doesn't cause tremendous numbers of queries, since that also tends to be resource intensive. and this is the part where I end up with issues: any post that isn't already in memcached ends up with junk.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the update I'll be releasing, I'm fixing this by marking the posts and postmeta buckets as temporary, and it's working fine as far as I can tell. so safely close as wontfix if you think it's not needed.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #11423 (user_nicename should get memcached) created</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
When displaying an author's page, there are queries:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;SELECT ID FROM users WHERE user_nicename='whoever'
SELECT display_name FROM users WHERE user_nicename = 'whoever'
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
the second one could be avoided with a non-persistent cache bucket indexed on user_nicename. we could store the user_id, for instance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
both of them could be avoided with the same bucket if the latter is made persistent.
&lt;/p&gt;

Now I'm thinking there was a mistake in &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/9730" title="#9730: defect (bug): The new date_i18n hook creates potential bugs in the admin interface (closed: fixed)"&gt;#9730&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;a class="missing wiki"&gt;11323?&lt;/a&gt; missed the call(s) to get_post_time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If we could get that straight and then add the $translate parameter to the existing filters, I think that would take care of it.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Yes, it's part of most themes including the standard one. You add it with the function {{{edit_post_link()}} That's not the point. The point is that when you've come from the front end, you want to be able to go back to it without opening a new tab/window.
&lt;/p&gt;

But if you click edit on the frontend, it opens in the current tab. (Good.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If there's an Edit link on the front-end, it's part of the theme or a plugin. Don't think we have control there. It may also let you edit the post in place.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;i&gt;Keywords&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It looks like qTranslate needs to hook get_comment_time() because it is being used in Walker_Comment for template output.  get_post_time() is not used in that manner, so it is not hooked.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'll get started on a patch to add date and time filters to Walker_Comment:start_el().
&lt;/p&gt;

I was able to reproduce the bug in a test environment using the qTranslate "Date / Time Conversion" setting.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I still haven't ruled out the "translate" parameter as a possible cause though.
&lt;/p&gt;

This discrepancy is my primary suspect now:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;get_comment_time('Y-m-d H:i:s', true, false)
get_post_time('Y-m-d H:i:s', true)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The post feed and comment feed are not using the "translate" parameters consistently.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you then edit and click view post, it opens in a new tab/window. (Bad.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This means I have two tabs open with different versions of the same article.

class Walker_Comment uses a completely different syntax for date output.  That at least explains why my themes are working when the feed is not.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;&amp;lt;?php printf(__('%1$s at %2$s'), get_comment_date(),  get_comment_time()) ?&amp;gt;

Personally I'd rather have the live site in a separate tab from the editor so I can go back and forth, but whatever the behavior is in 2.8.6 is what we should have it as in 2.9.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In 2.8.6 it still opens in a new tab/window.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'd like to do some testing around this before 3.0, as I remember it coming up in testing for 2.5 and being somewhat contentious based on different styles of workflow.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The View Post button acts similarly to the Preview one and seems mostly used to preview the post. Don't think it's often someone would edit/write a post then go to the front-end to read it. Most users would want to preview it and eventually fix typos or make changes which is faster/easier when the front-end is in another window/tab.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There is also the case where the users have both the admin and the front-end opened in two windows side by side (on a wide screen), making changes in the admin and previewing them straight away. That's how the Preview button works, updating the post in the same window. We could make the View Post act the same (instead of target="_blank" have target="viewpost").
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is also dependent on the settings in the browser. Newly opened tabs can be set to get focus (show) or open in the background.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'm going for "wontfix" on this since it's not a regression or new behaviour in 2.9.
&lt;/p&gt;

I believe it is good to use the BASENAME field as post_name for each post.
It makes it much easier to write redirection/rewrite rules for site transition.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Attached is a patch against wp-admin/import/mt.php from version 2.8.6.

I realize 2.9 is almost out the door, but I'm hoping to pin down whether this is a core bug or something going on with a plugin ASAP.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When I hit /comments/feed/ on my site, the comments appear in the correct order, but every one of the pubDate values begins with "Sun, 13 Dec 2009" and I'm certain none of the listed comments were added today.

Jane, there's a significant difference:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If the link is set to open in the same window, you can make it open in a new window.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Whereas, if the link is set to open in a new window, you can't make it open in the same window.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
When writing a new post or page, we should make it easier to link to internal content (a previous post or page). The "Easy Post-to-Post Links" plugin enables shortcuts based on post ID or slug, but I'm envisioning something more user-friendly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Something like you click a button for an internal link (though it should be same mechanism as for external link, possibly the popup could be sectioned or tabbed for external vs internal, like the media popup) and it allows you to search for a post or browse a list of existing content by title, date, author, etc. and select it for inclusion. It would allow you to enter the text you wanted linked, or would use the post title by default, maybe.
&lt;/p&gt;

Is there any other way of testing this issue without injecting the invalid utf8 by hacking the core?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For bottom-up testing, load the default filters and call your favorite function from the flow.  wp_write_post() is the only function that relies on the superglobal input.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;wp-admin/post.php
wp-admin/includes/post.php/write_post()
wp-admin/includes/post.php/wp_write_post()
wp-includes/post.php/wp_insert_post()

Aha! I think I finally figured out my problem: a plugin.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Textile 2 (Improved), version 2.1.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Once I disabled this plugin, the strange characters disappeared.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here's the description of that plugin (I don't know what any of this means, but it makes me think it conflicted with a core WordPress plugin or something):
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is a wrapper for Jim Riggs' PHP implementation of Brad Choate's Textile 2. It is feature compatible with the MovableType plugin. &lt;strong&gt;Does not play well with the Markdown, Textile, or Textile 2 plugins that ship with WordPress.&lt;/strong&gt; Packaged by Adam Gessaman.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
All I found is that while wp-comments-posts.php checks for trash status and bails, admin-ajax.php doesn't check when replying to comments in wp-admin. I was able to reply to a comment on a post that was trashed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Two patches correct this -- one adheres to string freeze, the other doesn't.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;i&gt;Keywords&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Milestone&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Moved to early 3.0 for now.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think this change is the correct behaviour but would like it to get more review and I don't think it is a blocker as 2.8 had the same behaviour.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
$user_id if set should always be a positive integer in order for it to make any sense.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It is true that now if $user_id was set to 0 - which has no sensible meaning we will now run the db query and create a WP_User for 0 which we wouldn't have done before.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I will add the second check in to remove this possibility
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Explaining the patch: Every browser is displaying off screen positioned text differently, and using left/right positioning can't work.
Solution: for rtl, uses text-indent instead.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Not as elegant, but works:
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://www.webaim.org/techniques/css/invisiblecontent/#techniques"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://www.webaim.org/techniques/css/invisiblecontent/#techniques&lt;/a&gt;

Happy to see the progress, way to go!

+1, if a lightbox is still used for this.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It will require a clever hack to load the desired tab directly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Oh, certainly, lightbox should still be used. Just open the Gallery tab instead of the Upload one.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Easy enough to do by changing the URL with JS, I should think.

The current patch doesn't seem to be the right thing to do here.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
SimplePie has determined that it wants to change the encoding and if this fails the function is meant to return false.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As for the caching of failed lookups it is something we could do but not for 2.9.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We need to work out what we should cache, and for how long.

In my tests the $deleted var is only set when you delete a single item and then it is set to 1 for bulk deletes it is not set.

I also don't want another string change now - moving to 3.0 for now.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I don't think get_the_content should have feed specific behaviour in it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think it may be better to add an argument to get_the_content - which makes it ignore pagination in the post and return everything so that the behaviour is explicit on that and not done based on is_feed() - I can see that there maybe a use for this in other places by plugins.
&lt;/p&gt;

This patch looks ok but I would like to get some more testing done on it - don't have IIS here.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Also would prefer to change this early in a release cycle just in case it causes issues.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Moving to 3.0 early.
&lt;/p&gt;

CC'ing ruslany as hopefully he can test it for us and give feedback.

      <title>Ticket #10543 (Incorrect (non-UTF-8) character handling in tag's name and slug) updated</title>

      <description>&lt;i&gt;Keywords&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Owner&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Status&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Milestone&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I don't think we should change this at this stage in the release cycle.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I would prefer to do this early in 3.0 along with &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/11175" title="#11175: defect (bug): wp_check_invalid_utf8() should drop invalid utf-8 chars only instead ... (closed: duplicate)"&gt;#11175&lt;/a&gt; and give the change time to get a good lot of testing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Moving to 3.0 for an early patch.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Is there any other way of testing this issue without injecting the invalid utf8 by hacking the core?
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;i&gt;Keywords&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;_get_page_link()&lt;/code&gt; looks fine to me - this check is whether or not the post has a public permalink yet or should just be referred by id - Trashed posts should be fine returning the real permalink.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Can you rephrase this ticket as a list of actual bugs - it is hard to investigate/fix without a list of actual issues.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I am going to fix the email subject issue for WordPress generated emails.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As far as I know the body of emails generated by WordPress is usually the raw data and wp_mail expects to be sending plain text emails.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don't want to be changing that for 2.9 - If there are still issues with email bodies could someone open a new ticket for a Future version to fix.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Many Thanks.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Ok looking back in time I am sure this used to work fine.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It turns out that I think this was broken by &lt;a class="changeset" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/11380" title="deprecate wp_specialchars() in favor of esc_html(). Encode quotes for ..."&gt;[11380]&lt;/a&gt; where Mark switched out wp_specialchars for esc_html - this changed the default behaviour to encode quotes when wp_specialchars defaulted to not encoding quotes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Unfortunately this functionality runs when the data is store in the db so even if we were to revert that a lot of people would still see the issue.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So it looks like we do need to undo this work in the relevant places where we want in non-html - we should however use &lt;code&gt;wp_specialchars_decode&lt;/code&gt; rather than &lt;code&gt;html_entity_decode.&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Ok some related tickets here:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3528" title="#3528: defect (bug): HTTP 304 status not sent correctly on PHP 5.2, breaking conditional ... (closed: fixed)"&gt;#3528&lt;/a&gt; - Looks like we used to send the Status: header for non-cgi setups - &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/4684/trunk/wp-includes/functions.php"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/4684/trunk/wp-includes/functions.php&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6779" title="#6779: defect (bug): domain.com to www.domain.com redirect is a 302 redirect (closed: fixed)"&gt;#6779&lt;/a&gt; - Change to wp_redirect to use the argument of header which takes a status - &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/12358"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/12358&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Also search through all calls to status_header for redirects we don't send it for &lt;code&gt;cgi-fcgi&lt;/code&gt; sapi where as all other calls to status_header are unconditional - I wonder if we should be rolling the cgi check into status header or whether the check in wp_redirect is specific to &lt;code&gt;Location&lt;/code&gt; headers
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What server software / php version are you running which exhibits the issue?
&lt;/p&gt;

It seems it's part of the things to come: &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/forms.html#attr-form-autocomplete"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/forms.html#attr-form-autocomplete&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If/when WordPress starts using the HTML 5 doctype by default, then fine, use @autocomplete . In the meantime, it's invalid and needs patching.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Also, what about the &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; I mentioned above?

If you look at a checkbox inside most plugins which do not follow the "Settings table" style layout, you'll probably see what i mean
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For example, See the checkboxes in the Screen Options on the write post page.

I'm confused by this. All plugins that are hosted on Wordpress.Org have a canonical id, the URL to the plugin.  For example: &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/google-sitemap-generator/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/google-sitemap-generator/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
No other plugin can have that URL, it is canonical.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Any plugins that update through another site ... well, it is the code serving updates on that site that has to worry about it. Not our problem.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ciao!

It'll get people to upgrade, but it'll rattle a lot of cages.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It's more likely to cause people to avoid the version that has that feature altogether, and/or install the Disable Core Update plugin.  Imagine the panic that would grip the blogosphere when alarmists get wind of the software vendor intentionally crippling admin panels.

I have tested this with DreamHost FastCGI environment and I cannot reproduce the issue either.
Maybe this is a regular CGI specific problem, not FastCGI.

      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/11417/1260682919000000</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Currently, WordPress chooses image slugs from their filenames, or the meta title if available.  (Some kind of EXIF thing that doesn't work most of the time?)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There's a huge problem with this.  If that meta field is numeric, WordPress changes the permalink structure to
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
/blog/year/month/post-title/attachment/123456/
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The blog author has no direct control over this, and it looks really bad when all of the other image permalinks have
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
/blog/year/month/post-title/filename/
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
WordPress needs to revert back to filename slugs when the meta title is numeric (garbage).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And don't let me blow your minds all at once here, but how about letting the blog author edit those slugs?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Perhaps the autocomplete="off" should go in the &amp;lt;form&amp;gt; element. It may not be accepted by the W3C but is the de-facto standard supported by almost all browsers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Leaving invalid (X)HTML in core WordPress code is unacceptable, IMO. It means that plugin and theme developers, among others, can no longer use the W3C validator to check that their plugin/theme/etc isn't producing invalid (X)HTML at a glance: they instead have to look or parse through the validation results to see if the reported issues are due to core WordPress files or not. What a pain. Consequently, I'm reopening this ticket.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
By the way, in WordPress 2.8.6 the dashboard now additionally contains the following invalid markup:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;&amp;lt;textarea class="comment" rows="3" cols="10"&amp;gt;Hi, this is a comment.&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;To delete a comment, just log in and view the post&amp;amp;#039;s comments. There you will have the option to edit or delete them.&amp;lt;/textarea&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
That &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; isn't permitted in &amp;lt;textarea&amp;gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

That changes nada. Some users have multiple nags on every admin page, and they still don't upgrade. We should force them to do so for their own sake.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Its a much less invasive method, and stresses the importance of it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Another option could be to extend the "Welcome" screen idea for 3.0 to have an "Upgrade!" screen listing the benefits of upgrading.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Locking a user out of their blog should &lt;em&gt;NOT&lt;/em&gt; be an option, It'll get people to upgrade, but it'll rattle a lot of cages. Its not like WordPress is being provided as a service to users, Its their choice to run it, and their choice to uprade. Nagging is all that can be done.
&lt;/p&gt;

I can see one good reason -- stats. md5($url) cannot go through parse_url() in order to eliminate dup data from the same domain: two sites or more on subdomains, multiple sites in folders, etc.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If the problem is eliminating duplicate entries per domain, then the solution is simply to parse the URL &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; hashing it.

there also are cases where the plugin is not on wp.org at all, for all sorts of reasons. for instance, the wp.org folder could be empty yet "taken".

Why can't we simply do an MD5 hash of the URL?  We need a unique identifier, but do we need to know the actual URL?  I can't see any reason why we do.
&lt;/p&gt;

ok, Given 2.8.x is supposed to be supported until 3.0 is released(I think that was decided upon?), This ticket makes hardly any sense for major releases.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This ticket is less about major releases than it is about minor ones that fix security issues.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Changing the colour of the update notice depending on how long the update has been out is an option..
&lt;/p&gt;

That changes nada. Some users have multiple nags on every admin page, and they still don't upgrade. We should force them to do so for their own sake.

      <description>&lt;i&gt;Cc&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Would it not be better to move the escaping of the closing CDATA into a function on the &lt;code&gt;the_content&lt;/code&gt; filter which can then itself check is_feed() and also if necessary easily be removed by a plugin?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
However as has been said before we don't want to change this too much close to release maybe we should just move the current code to a filter function for now but with no conditional check.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

This sounds like a good idea to me.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I am wary of changing the return value of a function this close to release - would have rather done this pre-beta to make sure plugin authors had a chance to catch anywhere they are relying on current behaviour.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We should also change wp_load_image to return a WP_Error at the same time I agree.

I am creating a plugin to remove some menu items from the administrator panel. It works perfectly on every menu item except the 'comments' menu item. No matter what I do, it does not disappear. Code attached:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
global $menu, $submenu, $user_ID;
$the_user = new WP_User($user_ID);
reset($menu); $page = key($menu);
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
/*Get Menu Item*/
while (('Comments' != $menu[$page]&lt;a class="missing changeset" title="No changeset 0 in the repository"&gt;[0]&lt;/a&gt;) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; next($menu)) {
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$page = key($menu);
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
}
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
/*Unset Menu Item*/
if ('Comments' == $menu[$page]&lt;a class="missing changeset" title="No changeset 0 in the repository"&gt;[0]&lt;/a&gt;) {
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
unset($menu[$page]);

Ok.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So the issue here is that if you specify the number of significant figures to show for a particular locale then that is used regardless of whether or not the number is a float.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think at present everything we format is an integer hence the recommendation to stick with 0 for the value in the translation file.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I have an alternative patch for this but I think the best solution for you for 2.9 is to stick with 0 in the translation file like the other translators do and we can look at what to change here early in 3.0 - I wonder whether or not this value should be offered up for translation at all as it is doesn't feel like a locale issue how many significant figures are displayed
&lt;/p&gt;

Potential alternative solution, for those who have permalinks enabled:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} /favicon.ico$
RewriteRule . $home_path/wp-includes/favicon.ico [L]
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
others would need to hook into a favicon hook as suggested above.

we might as well add a WP icon in this case, though. :-P

How about, in the installer/upgrader, check for file existence, then create the zero byte file on the fly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I like that idea...

The check in akismet won't actually work anyway.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For Example &lt;code&gt;"Howdy" &amp;amp;&amp;amp; long2ip(ip2long("Howdy"))&lt;/code&gt; will evaluate to true as the string evaluates to true and the false returned by ip2long will cast to an int(0) fine which becomes an ip address of "0.0.0.0" which as a string with evaluate to true.
&lt;/p&gt;

Actually that's easy to do: add &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;tab=library&lt;/code&gt; to the button's href (from a plugin). The whole uploader UI will likely change in the Media update so this would probably be handled too.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
True. I was thinking about this usecase:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;User edits a post with no images in the gallery (the url is &amp;amp;tab=upload)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol start="2"&gt;&lt;li&gt;User adds an image to the gallery and then closes the box
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol start="3"&gt;&lt;li&gt;User clicks the Add Image button again (the url will still be &amp;amp;tab=upload)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;
You would have to change the URL through JS just after the first image is added to the gallery.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
another way to phrase this, in case it's not entirely clear to whoever looks into it... there is a wp_cache_get() call over in get_terms(), which has no equivalent over in:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;$reqtag = get_term_by( 'slug', $q['tag_slug__in'][0], 'post_tag' );
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
We might want to add it?
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
over in wp_query, it seems that:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;$reqcat = get_category_by_path($q['category_name']);
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
gets filled into memcached, because of:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;$categories = get_terms( 'category', "get=all&amp;amp;slug=$leaf_path" );
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
on the tags' end, though, (or other taximonies, I would assume) there is no equivalent.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;i&gt;Keywords&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Ok I have tested locally with php using fast-cgi with apache2 and I cannot reproduce the issue you are seeing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The patch appears to apply fine without causing any issues when not running as fast cgi so I think it should be safe to apply however I would like to get a 2nd-opinion before committing as I cannot reproduce the issue and I know we have had issues getting this working correctly in the past.
&lt;/p&gt;

I don't think we should rush this into 2.9 at the last minute so I am going to set a 3.0 milestone for this.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I am not sure why you need this for your plugin - maybe you could write up a simple summary of the issue you are having and the reason why this is the best solution to resolve the issue.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Without that it is very hard to review the change requested here.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>wontfix: &lt;p&gt;
I consider it bad form to override a website’s favicon, even if it is only for the backend.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Also, as I explained in the wp-dev channel, with the change you propose people with more than one WP sites won’t be able to distinguish their different dashboards by looking at the favicon.  All dashboards will have the same favicon.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In addition, there are already plugins that let you do exactly what you want:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/shockingly-simple-favicon/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/shockingly-simple-favicon/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/extended-options/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/extended-options/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
(Just two I could remember off the top of my head.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ergo, closing as wontfix. :-)

      <description>duplicate: &lt;p&gt;
As I said on the other ticket I think this message/check fits into the teritory of a plugin which can have a faster update cycle and can check a lot more things to measure the health of your install - using the same paradigm as a password strength checker measures your password and offing recommendations on how you can improve things.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I'm giving 2.9 beta a test drive for theme development purposes. On my test installation, I currently have the two default themes and a very simple theme of my own that I developed via a tutorial.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After I upgraded to 2.9 beta, the sidebar calendar started displaying rather oddly. It looks okay when the main page first loads, but when I click the &amp;lt;&amp;lt;Nov link, the calendar rows are way out of whack. When click on &amp;lt;&amp;lt;Oct, it's not as bad, but still incorrect. Then, when I go forward again and hit December, even that is a little bit off.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This happens whether I use the Calendar widget or just the theme's own sidebar, and it happens in all three installed themes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My test site is at &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://bleeder.faltarego.com"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://bleeder.faltarego.com&lt;/a&gt;
or &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://faltarego.com/bleeder"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://faltarego.com/bleeder&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Many thanks.

Replying to &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/11395#comment:3" title="Comment 3"&gt;filosofo&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If we really need &lt;code&gt;get_current_user_id()&lt;/code&gt; or the like let's create it.  Let's not add any hidden, unexpected functionality to existing functions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Personally, I see it as a bonus. It's like... if I check if a user is logged in for some functionality, the odds are 80% that I'll then wonder which one might be logged in, in order to check a user meta. So might as well return the user's id.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I do see your point that it ought to be named get_current_user_id(), though.
&lt;/p&gt;

@azaozz I just wanted to know if any planning had been done for this as an official feature.  The wording of the ticket strikes me a bit like, "Let's abstract the universe."  Focusing on a single storage engine is something that WordPress has done very well so far.

Better to have a working version 2.8 site than a crippled admin panel.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Oh, but that's another problem entirely. that issue has to do with testing, testing, testing, testing, ... (x100 times more), testing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I wonder... Say, has anyone been arguing since around 2.8.0 (and 3 years earlier, but nobody remembers) that we should a) keep the bloody ticket list to a manageable level, b) lengthen the release cycle, c) lengthen the test cycle in order to ensure we've proper QA in WP, and d) (more recently) increase the number of core devs so that potential contributors stay around for long enough to get involved instead of fleeing away from lack of traction? Mm... I wonder who that might be...
&lt;/p&gt;

Once 2.9 is out the door I am going to spend sometime reviewing this to understand the full extent of the changes and how well it will integrate into WP.

If insecurity is the argument, then the on the other hand WordPress shouldn't support PHP4.  Doesn't it feel duplicitous to say that the host should be ashamed of the PHP version, meanwhile WordPress asserts none of the PHP5-specific features?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I couldn't say any better, but I know others will disagree. Still, I've found that scaring the daylights out of end-users goes to great lengths when it comes to getting them to upgrade. My own "A new WP version is available. Please update now." nag is "A new WP version is available. Please update now before your site gets hacked" (with a link to matt's september post for lengthier explanations). And they do click on it more often.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
if a user has has own favicon file, he probable doesn't want the WP favicon to overwrite his own. so this ought to be fixed at the php level. :-)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Personally, I'm picturing something like... at the very beginning of the main request:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/wp-includes/classes.php?rev=11930#L488"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/wp-includes/classes.php?rev=11930#L488&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;if preg_match favicon_request
  then if $file = apply_filters('wp_favicon, false) !== false
   then
    send appropriate headers
    readfile($file);
   endif
    else
   send send 404 headers
  endif
  die
endif
&lt;/pre&gt;</description>

-1  What's the benefit?  Who's going to support this?  What happens to all the plugins?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are (AFAIK) several large sites that use it at the moment, also see the previous comment by scottporad. It might break some old/unsupported/unpopular plugins that use MySQL directly, have you found a plugin that breaks?
&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Sat, 12 Dec 2009 21:48:41 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/11413</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
When a user makes a shortcut in their browser to directly access the Add New Post page or another page within the wordpress backend administration area the favorite is saved in the end users browser without an associated .ico file .
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
see screen shot of example FireFox Browser but same in all browsers.
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://i48.tinypic.com/donxtz.jpg"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://i48.tinypic.com/donxtz.jpg&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This can cause confusion for the end user accessing their administration pages directly from a short cut that has adopted another site's .ico file since wordpress install is not providing the link.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Although ico files should be in the ico format and they should be named favicon.ico there is a fast work around until a core designer can provide such a file.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
this image in the folder /wp-includes/images/wlw/wp-icon.png
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
may be used for testing
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
the wordpress core file that needs to be edited is
wp-admin/admin-header.php
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
add this line after the closing &amp;lt;/title&amp;gt; element.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;lt;link rel="shortcut icon" href="../wp-includes/images/wlw/wp-icon.png" type="image/x-icon" /&amp;gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This will provide end users with a WordPress ico pointer that will display the ico file in the browser url bar and when shortcuts are made in browser menus.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Again this is a temporary work around until a designer can find an appropriate ico file to be used for the backend admin area.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here is an example image of the problem shown in windows firefox when no WordPress ico file is linked to in the Admin area.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The user makes a shortcut and the ADD NEW POST favorite shows an ico from a random site such as Twitter or Youtube in this example image
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://i48.tinypic.com/donxtz.jpg"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://i48.tinypic.com/donxtz.jpg&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The reason why this is important is that end users mistake their shortcuts to their own site to ones like youtube and do not have a good experience.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
An official WordPress Ico should be used for the backend that way a user can quickly identify their homepage shortcut vs a backend shortcut.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
is this too long? heh
&lt;/p&gt;

The reality for anyone who uses plugins is that the core upgrades are incompatible until proven otherwise.

I would know, yeah... That WP breaks much about everything with every new release has been my bread winner for almost 5 years now. :-)

      <description>&lt;i&gt;Milestone&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I'm actually re-opening this, too. The reasoning is this: I've had a few users who reported they were using php5 based on their CPanel install. But the fact of the matter is they had a cgi underneath that enforced php5. So, some users are believing they've php5 when they're really using php4.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We ought to direct those users to switch to php5. That this only concerns 10% of users is no valid argument.
&lt;/p&gt;

It's okay Denis.  The way I see it, as long as PHP4 is supported, nobody is going to pay attention to a notice that says PHP5 should be installed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You'd be surprised, actually. It's just a matter of writing the nag as it should be. I added one in my Version Checker plugin. It basically goes: you should tell your host they should be ashamed to leave your site on such an insecure platform -- with links to the php4 is no longer maintained announcement. And sure enough, users have been upgrading *very* fast.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Why can't we simply do an MD5 hash of the URL?  We need a unique identifier, but do we need to know the actual URL?  I can't see any reason why we do.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One line of code in WP to resolve any privacy issues I can imagine....
&lt;/p&gt;

Actually that's easy to do: add &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;tab=library&lt;/code&gt; to the button's href (from a plugin). The whole uploader UI will likely change in the Media update so this would probably be handled too.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
WP should not load in its entirety on favicon.ico requests, unless a plugin allows it to.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We should add the needed RewriteCond to the .htaccess statements. Or at the very least catch that sort of request early on (while we parse the request, for instance), apply filters in case a plugin wants to step in, and bail accordingly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As things stand, every page load on a site without a favicon generates a 404 error that gets logged -- and on each of these, WP loads in its entirety, and hopelessly queries the database in an effort to canonically redirect to something that might work.
&lt;/p&gt;

Wasn't there supposed to be a nag in 2.9, under Tools / Upgrade, that tells users to switch to switch to php5 when relevant, so we could move forward with the latter?

After so many days, we should send electrical shocks through their keyboards.  I think there's an ActiveX method that lets you do that.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Heh, you'd be surprised. I recently ran into a user who had had upgrade nags for over 18 months. She simply ignored them... And I know for a fact that she is not alone among my customers who do this. Some even have multiple error messages on the top of each page (e.g. plugin A requires this, plugin B requires that...) in addition, and a plugin update nag complete with a Mass Upgrade button, and a theme update nag. And they just cope with having to scroll down half a screen in order to post. :-(

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I often save a post, and find that only half of the post has been transferred and saved. This is undoubtedly due to my incredibly slow internet connection, but it is still extremely frustrating when I loose a whole load of changes by having to revert to the last revision to get the rest of my post back. And of course if it's the first time I've saved it, I have to start from scratch. (Yes, I should save more often, but (a) I get more useless revisions and (b) it takes soooo long on my connection...)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Proposed solution:&lt;br /&gt;
Before saving, create an md5 hash of the post using JavaScript. Submit this with the post, and compare it to the md5 hash of the received data before saving.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
A potential problem with this is if a new argument is later added to the function.  Then you could have old plugins passing data to the missing parameter, but the new version of the function accepting it as the new parameter.  Might mess things up.

      <description>&lt;i&gt;Keywords&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Nevermind, cancel the patch, it's too simplistic, it just bypasses the location ascii regex
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It would be nice if we could assume that if the user specified siteurl was the same as the actual location that everything was ok but we probably can't.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'll leave the patch here, so it's easy to see what the issue is.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
boils down to 2 issues.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;the native php header function does not support IDN names.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;WordPress needs actual support for IDN names, something like idn_to_ascii
(if we had the above, we could still use the existing ascii preg_replace, just run the idn_to_ascii prior)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;
there are several IDN libraries around, most are GPL'd, I don't mind adding one but I'm
probably not the right person to make that call.
&lt;/p&gt;

wp_count_comments() gets called on every admin page. It's not a super expensive on, but it probably belongs in a transient that gets updated whenever the number of pending comment changes.

And this shouldn't be shown except for those with permissions allowing them to upgrade; low-permission users should have an undisrupted admin (with the current small notice at the top).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Actually, I tend to disagree here. Unless I'm mistaking, the latest series of security issues all involved non-privileged users who escalated themselves as admin users. So if we go the route of preventing the admin area from working at all (which I'd +1, personally), it should really be entirely, for every user.
&lt;/p&gt;

I had to fix this in a plugin of mine earlier this year. If memory serves, it was due to logic errors in the timeout related to the checked variable, or something like that. I'm attaching the code I'm currently using for plugin version checking, in case it helps.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Or even disable the whole admin and just show a notice telling the user to upgrade. It would have to be possible to hide these notices with a constant in wp-config, for those who &lt;em&gt;can't&lt;/em&gt; upgrade.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I've seen this in action now and the sped-up fade is super distracting, not in a good way. It feels intrusive in a way that the WordPress admin doesn't feel anywhere else. I vote we get rid of the opacity changes altogether and just count on placement and background shading to make it clear that it's an alert message.
&lt;/p&gt;

It will require a clever hack to load the desired tab directly.

I upload all the images for my post, then go through adding them to the post. For each one I click Add Image, and it takes me to the Upload page. I then have to click Gallery to find the image I want to add.&lt;br /&gt;
This is particularly annoying since I normally have a slow internet connection, but it's annoying even with a fast connection.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Expected behaviour :&lt;br /&gt;
If images have already been uploaded for a post, then clicking Add Image should open the Gallery tab.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Some users ignore upgrades for all sorts of reasons, and end up putting their site at risk.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While I find it perfectly understandable to wait a few weeks when a new major release is around, the behavior is completely nuts when it's a minor release that addresses a security.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Just tossing ideas around, but... would it make sense to make WP gently nag as it does initially. And when it's obvious that the site's owner is ignoring the nag after two weeks, WP places a huge nag on all admin pages: a lengthy page that highlights that the blog's security is being put at risk. It should occupy enough screen place to make the site's admin area hard to use until the site actually gets upgraded.
&lt;/p&gt;

+1 to this idea.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Question though - how would such removal be dealt with, would it not introduce as many performance issues as it solves? I'm thinking e.g filtering out pre-existing private posts added before such functionality were enabled..

There had been a ticket over in 2.8, and if memory serves the general agreement was that opening the preview link in a new window made sense, while opening the view post link in the same window was preferable. (Or maybe this discussion was on the View Site link...)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class="changeset" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/12020" title="Open View/Preview post in a new window from the link in the ..."&gt;r12020&lt;/a&gt;, I am assuming, re-introduced the clumsy behavior two months ago. Could we change this back to where the general agreement stood? It's quite annoying to no longer be able to Edit, Save Chances, and then View Post without ending up with a) an extra tab and b) WP later complaining that a new version of the post or page exists because the useless tab was not closed on the spot.
&lt;/p&gt;

In WP, they'd just return true. This would be for use with a memcached backend.

Replying to &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/11394#comment:2" title="Comment 2"&gt;scribu&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I would add to the required attributes &lt;em&gt;url&lt;/em&gt; for external images. So an image must have either an id or an url attribute.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yes; of course. I should have thought of that. But I'd make it &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; like the html img tag - otherwise it could be confused with a url which should be linked to. And incidentally, we'd need that too - Id suggest calling it &lt;code&gt;link&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think "blessed" means it was agreed on in the dev chat, no? So I'll set it to that.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #11404 (Convert use of _nc() to _nx()) created</title>
      
        <dc:creator>nacin</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Sat, 12 Dec 2009 08:25:31 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/11404</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/11404/1260606331000000</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
_c() was deprecated for _x(). Core still uses _nc() in one spot, however. Patch moves that over to _nx().
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Patch also formally deprecates _nc() and moves it to deprecated.php, next to its sibling _c().
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I imagine other deprecated moves can be handled in &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/11388" title="#11388: enhancement: Deprecated functions: Formally deprecate and/or move to deprecated.php (closed: fixed)"&gt;#11388&lt;/a&gt; for 3.0.

      <description>&lt;i&gt;Cc&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Honestly, I feel this is attributable to a bug in php itself
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=45657"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=45657&lt;/a&gt; (they of course disagree)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
so, the (ugly) work around (acceptable?) is to use a html meta redirect.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If we could count on a idn_to_ascii method being available in a typical WordPress environment
then 'header' would work. (but I doubt we can)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;(PHP 5 &amp;gt;= 5.3.0, PECL intl &amp;gt;= 1.0.2)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;$location = idn_to_ascii($location)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The included diff is one approach that would resolve the issue.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
this fix assumes that the domain name they wish to use
is set in general settings (wp-admin/options-general.php) as WordPress address (URL)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Another possible approach would be to add a (optional) field to the wp-config.php file
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Something like 'IDN name', one could put the punycode version of the url here.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
then if that variable is set, make sure the header redirect would use it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
# support for IDN names&lt;br /&gt;
define('IDN_AS_PUNYCODE', 'xn--domne-ura.dk');&lt;br /&gt;
domæne.dk -&amp;gt; (as punycode) -&amp;gt; xn--domne-ura.dk
&lt;/p&gt;

The red asterisk position will be fixed (or maybe removed) in 3.0.
&lt;/p&gt;

Meant to say "define('MEDIA_TRASH', true); in wp-config.php"...
&lt;/p&gt;

Can be enabled by adding &lt;code&gt;define('MEDIA_TRASH', true);&lt;/code&gt; in wp-settings.php. If there are any attachments in the trash, it will still show on the Media Library screen until they are restored or deleted.
&lt;/p&gt;

Replying to &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5066#comment:27" title="Comment 27"&gt;Denis-de-Bernardy&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;WP version, Plugin version, and Theme version are all needed for update checks
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Not so. A client doesn't need to give its &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; version to request and receive the current version of WP core, plugins, or themes.  In fact a request sans self-identification would take up less bandwidth and the response would involve fewer CPU cycles on the part of the WP.org server.  So not only is it not technically necessary, there are technical reasons (i.e. outside the moral issue of privacy) to prefer it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And to really save bandwidth and CPU cycles, we could push out update info with something like PubSubHubbub or RSSCloud.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #2691 (HTML comments in posts aren't handled properly.) reopened</title>
      
        <dc:creator>vikingjs</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Sat, 12 Dec 2009 02:26:20 GMT</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I can't believe this got no traction - I use plugins that conscientiously mark where their added content begins and ends using HTML comments, and those comments are adding empty paragraphs in my posts, which in some cases affect layout and undermine the aesthetics of the page.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This issue affects anyone who uses plugins that modify the text of the blog post, e.g., SexyBookmarks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'll look at what it would take to patch it, but someone who knows how and where the unwanted behavior is occurring could do it in a fraction of the time.
&lt;/p&gt;
