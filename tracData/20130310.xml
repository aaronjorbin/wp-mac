viewing autosaves is a -currently hidden- option - investigating adding as a screen option. i will turn on viewing autosaves by default in next patch.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Looking through the responses on this survey, it's actually interesting to note that a large portion of users (about 25%) looking at revisions are expecting to be able to compare the changes in an autosave from the published version to see what was saved. This actually makes a lot of sense. If someone were to restore an autosave, something interrupted them, and now they have no idea what changes were saved in the autosave, and which weren't. Some responses also indicated that some users thought that revisions could help them compare the changes they've made right there in the editor, regardless of autosave or published revisions (much like how MediaWiki has a "show changes" option from their editor).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Is there really any reason autosave revisions shouldn't also be available to compare with regular revisions (because they aren't right now)? They are a revision with changes, even if they aren't published.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If they were included, the UI would certainly have to be clear (with some kind of indicators in the slider, and in the diffs) about which revision is the current published revision, but otherwise, I don't see any reason why they shouldn't be available for comparison.
&lt;/p&gt;

You don't need to speculate on what I do or don't realize. Just ask instead. :)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I tagged you, and explained what I thought you meant, fully expecting you to reply with a clarification, correction, or (preferably) just an acknowledgement. My experience with open source issue trackers (especially this one) has taught me to never rely on a response though, so I tend to avoid direct questions unless it's the OP in order to maintain progress on a ticket. It doesn't mean I didn't want your input though, I was asking for it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since you still don't appear to have any corrections though, I'm assuming you agree then. (see, no direct questions)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
as i recall that conversation happened before the two handle slider mode was even an idea. now that we have the compare two functionality, i'm going to restore the previous method, actually a relief for me as thats the way i intuitively felt it should operate.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #23584 (Twenty Thirteen: Gallery captions are hidden) updated</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Hi I tried adding a gallery to my dev build of the twenty thirteen and found a couple layout issues.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
See attached Screenshot. (Screenshot is reduced to show full gallery view)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://cl.ly/image/180D0F2P1l36"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;2 col gallery&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The details:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
8 images in single post gallery view. &lt;br /&gt;
The thumbnail size was increased to 200px from the default 150px. &lt;br /&gt;
Gallery set to 3 column view &lt;br /&gt;
Caption on the second image is 40 words long and a typical caption. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The text at the bottom of the page is in the content are of the page and not in the gallery.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If the gallery is set to 2 column the view is still the same. &lt;br /&gt;
If the gallery is set to 1 column the images do follow the one column and the caption is aligned left.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #23216 (Create "WP Heartbeat" API) updated</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Replying to &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/23216" title="#23216: task (blessed): Create &amp;#34;WP Heartbeat&amp;#34; API (closed: fixed)"&gt;azaozz&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The purpose of this API is to simulate bidirectional connection between the browser and the server. Initially it will be used for autosave, post locking and log-in expiration warning while a user is writing or editing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So does this mean that Wordpress will be implementing a database sync framework? With a web based publishing platform, how are you going to save data locally to be synced with the server upon reconnecting? Since most Wordpress sites are not multi-server setups, how is the heart-beat going to work on a "Single Point of Failure "if the server crashes, storm takes out internet ect?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I could understand such a system if you were running ManageWP.com, they could check for connection loss and re-connection since their system (acting as a middle man) could then sync the data. I just don't see or can understand any benefit to adding this stuff if it can't do any more than what the current system does.. Unless of course you are going to re-write the admin utilizing something like &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://appjs.org/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://appjs.org/&lt;/a&gt; but I would doubt it. Am I missing something?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In regards to the future plans, Why not do something like most Wiki's and set a "being edited" flag.. You can show a notice to another editor that the article is currently being written/edited.. And or use ajax like live chat clients letting each editor see that the current document is being editing by such and such, once document is saved, give the green light to whos next. When the document is saved or canceled, remove the "being edited" flag.
&lt;/p&gt;

@helen, it would be helpful to see the report of the actual survey mentioned, it might help give us some insight into what you mean.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
An Automattician (I think lessbloat, but not 100% sure) had done a quick survey of .com users and shared it in IRC: &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Av7nMZXUOf52dDc0QVowVHRXR29QeXk0YXJaX2l3TVE#gid=0"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Av7nMZXUOf52dDc0QVowVHRXR29QeXk0YXJaX2l3TVE#gid=0&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I understand what @helen was trying to explain, but I think she didn't realize that the compare page could open the "compare two revisions" mode with the current version against the revision selected by default (where applicable), and that's really what she may have meant (maybe you didn't even have that functionality finished yet at the time?).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If the slider only allows selection of one revision, the changes in just that revision are what the user wants to see. If the slider allows selection of two revisions, then we compare the range of changes. As far as the actual UI control logic, that seems entirely clear.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What you have in trunk right now is two different modes where the functionality of one of them (the single revision selection) is already covered by the second mode, and so now it doesn't really provide any advantage over the "compare two revisions" mode. And in the process of doing this, it's now also not possible to easily browse single revision changes. The two modes are there to complement each other with functionality the other mode doesn't provide, right? Otherwise there's not much point in even having the second mode.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
@helen, it would be helpful to see the report of the actual survey mentioned, it might help give us some insight into what you mean.
&lt;/p&gt;

i agree, its confusing! my original take on the interface had the comparison always be to the previous revision, showing 'whats changed in this revision. i think this is what you were expecting to see as well.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
this idea wasn't well accepted in our revisions team meeting and the consensus was that the diff view should show the difference between the current post data and the viewed revision.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Huh? This makes very little sense. Single-handle scrubber mode should show what changed in that particular revision. Comparing to current is very unexpected behavior. If you wanted to compare to current, you have the two-handle scrubber.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
ok, glad you agree with the concept of the single handle slider showing &lt;em&gt;whats changed in each revision compared to the previous revision&lt;/em&gt; instead of &lt;em&gt;whats changed between each revision and the current version&lt;/em&gt;. thats the way i thought it should work and thats the way it was originally coded in my backbone code, but in our meeting &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://irclogs.wordpress.org/chanlog.php?channel=wordpress-dev&amp;amp;day=2013-02-18&amp;amp;sort=asc#m558028"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;IRC chat&lt;/a&gt;, @helen felt that was confusing to the end user and the consensus seemed to be the comparison should be to the current version...
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
so, should i just reverse that decision and go back to showing each revision's changes, or should we offer an option? will bring up at tomorrows office hours, appreciate any feedback.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
this idea wasn't well accepted in our revisions team meeting and the consensus was that the diff view should show the difference between the current post data and the viewed revision. i'm not entirely convinced, however - i really liked the mode that showed the change in each revision... one idea would be to enable a 'compare to previous' feature in the single slider handle mode.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
once we get the code a little more polished and clear bugs, i would love to see some user testing like the tests of the menu system @lessbloat ran a few weeks ago.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
thanks for the feedback and testing, stay tuned here for updates.

&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;from your description though, wouldn't 'four' show in any position? note that &lt;em&gt;the diff view in single handle mode shows what has changed between the current version and the selected revision&lt;/em&gt;. if the current version contains the 'four' edit, that will show on the +Added side of the diff for every revision comparison. again:  the view shows compare to current, not what happened in the revision (i tried it that way, but it wasn't liked)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
How are you supposed to know what content (in the selected revision) you are actually restoring then without opening "compare two revisions"? And if you do have that open, "restore revision" becomes even more confusing. This seems incredibly unhelpful, and definitely confusing if you come from the old revisions page or Wikipedia diffs. There's no possible way to see what the real changes were in a single revision other than the first revision without opening the "compare two revisions" feature, but I always thought that was one of the primary use-cases for revisions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
MikeHansenMe is right, this is all very confusing UI.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You open revisions and start out on a diff from the latest revision to the next oldest (MediaWiki provides "prev" links rather than making you select both revisions manually for that use case, and I'm guessing they do since it's so frequently used), but from there on out, I would *always* end up checking "compare two revisions", and painstakingly selecting each revision by moving both slider buttons one tick at a time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Anyway, if the way it works now is how it's going to be, you're right that it needs to be significantly more apparent - like adding the exact revisions (and dates) above each column on Removed/Added.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If you look at the code you see that the error isn't on that place. The data from wp_get_attachment_metadata() isn't how it should. Maybe a plugin does something wrong or you did a replace query on urls. However last one would most likely not show these errors.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Seems like the &lt;code&gt;deactivate&lt;/code&gt; event isn't fired when the submenu will be left with the mouse. To solve this I have added the &lt;code&gt;menu.on( 'mouseleave',&lt;/code&gt; part.
&lt;/p&gt;

Hi,

&lt;p&gt;
I tried to log in to my admin panel for www.media-magnet.co.uk. I selected 'forgot password' and entered my e-mail address to receive a new one and I received a display message stating that 'ERROR: There is no user registered with that email address', help! I know I entered the correct e-mail address.

The plugin that generates the sidebar widget where the errors show up is eshop, but the error doesn't point to any files from the eshop plugin.

Do you have web development add-on or other extension modifying your user agent string?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That string pretty clearly corresponds to Firefox 10.
&lt;/p&gt;

We need to pass more information to the 'wp_dropdown_pages' filter for others to make decisions with.  Here's a small &amp;amp; quick patch for passing more args to the filter.

I'm getting many errors like these. Is this a problem with a plugin, or with WordPress core?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The errors seems to be happening in core files, so I thought I'd post it here.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To see the actual errors, see the following site (at the time of this writing), in the right sidebar (scroll down):
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://creationofsociety.com"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://creationofsociety.com&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Playing with it a bit, I find a slight improvement on the "Comments" menu (which has no submenu) by using rowSelector: "&amp;gt; li" instead. This makes it activate on the comments menu, which can cause it removes the currently open menu (like Pages) when the movement is in the "wrong" direction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Tweaks like that, along with adjusting the timing, could be a real improvement.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #23608 (3.6-Menus Help Text changes) updated</title>

      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/23608#comment:5/1362869720237660</guid>
      <description>&lt;i&gt;Keywords&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/23608/23608.diff" title="Attachment '23608.diff' in Ticket #23608"&gt;23608.diff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/23608/23608.diff" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt; takes a full pass at the Menus help text. I did my best to incorporate as many of the existing strings as possible.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There's no doubt this should be trimmed down quite a bit, I just wanted to get it out there for the rest of the docs folks to pick over.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;[ Tab: Overview ]&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This screen is used for managing your custom navigation menus.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Menus can be assigned to locations defined by your theme, you can even use custom menus in conjunction with the Custom Menus widget on the Widgets screen. If your theme does not support the custom menus feature (the default themes, Twenty Thirteen and Twenty Twelve, do), you can learn about adding this support by following the Documentation link to the side.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
From this screen you can:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create, edit, and delete menus
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add, remove, or rearrange menu items in individual menus
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Assign menus to be used in specific theme locations
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;[ Tab: Add &amp;amp; Edit Menus ]&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Use the menu management box at the top of the screen to add or select existing menus to edit.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;To create your first menu, either give your default menu a name then save by &lt;strong&gt;clicking ’Create Menu’&lt;/strong&gt; or following the steps to add a new menu.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To create a new menu &lt;strong&gt;click the ’Add New’ button&lt;/strong&gt; at the top of the screen. Give your menu a name, then &lt;strong&gt;click ’Create Menu’&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To edit an existing menu, choose a menu from the drop down and &lt;strong&gt;click ’Select’&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Custom menus may contain links to pages, categories, custom links or other content types (use the Screen Options tab to decide which ones to show on the screen). If your theme includes more than one menu location, you can choose which custom menu to associate with each.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add menu items by selecting links from the boxes in the left column and &lt;strong&gt;clicking ’Add to Menu’&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To rearrange items, &lt;strong&gt;drag and drop items with your mouse or use your keyboard&lt;/strong&gt;. Drag or move a menu item a little to the right to make it a submenu.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Delete a menu item by expanding it and &lt;strong&gt;clicking the Remove link&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;[ Tab: Other Settings ]&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In addition to the standard menu item settings, you can also set additional attributes for each menu item. Attributes like link target, CSS classes, link relationships and link descriptions can be enabled and disabled via the Screen Options tab.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You can find more information about additional menu item attributes by following the Documentation link to the side.
&lt;/p&gt;

No better way to see it than to try it, so here's a testing-the-idea patch against trunk. It seems to work but needs some adjustment on the leaving-the-menu and a few other minor things. But, in general, it does seem like something of an improvement.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
See 23731-POC.diff for test patch.
&lt;/p&gt;

I am fully in favor of this. It could be used to benefit both back- and front-end UX (after we educated theme makers, naturally).

I think this is a great idea (and after I drew a diagram of how this would make her less frustrated on the Internet, so does my wife). Can/should we run some tests?

I'm not sure how well this would work with the minimized menu, since it's so narrow.

Replying to &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/23497#comment:62" title="Comment 62"&gt;adamsilverstein&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;from your description though, wouldn't 'four' show in any position? note that &lt;em&gt;the diff view in single handle mode shows what has changed between the current version and the selected revision&lt;/em&gt;. if the current version contains the 'four' edit, that will show on the +Added side of the diff for every revision comparison. again:  the view shows compare to current, not what happened in the revision (i tried it that way, but it wasn't liked)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
How are you supposed to know what content (in the selected revision) you are actually restoring then without opening "compare two revisions"? And if you do have that open, "restore revision" becomes even more confusing. This seems incredibly unhelpful, and definitely confusing if you come from the old revisions page or Wikipedia diffs. There's no possible way to see what the real changes were in a single revision other than the first revision without opening the "compare two revisions" feature, but I always thought that was one of the primary use-cases for revisions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
MikeHansenMe is right, this is all very confusing UI.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You open revisions and start out on a diff from the latest revision to the next oldest (MediaWiki provides "prev" links rather than making you select both revisions manually for that use case, and I'm guessing they do since it's so frequently used), but from there on out, I would *always* end up checking "compare two revisions", and painstakingly selecting each revision by moving both slider buttons one tick at a time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Anyway, if the way it works now is how it's going to be, you're right that it needs to be significantly more apparent - like adding the exact revisions (and dates) above each column on Removed/Added.
&lt;/p&gt;

absolutely. and pls make sure it is easy to be used also outside admin (current component designation for this ticket) - in themes etc. been waiting for it 5 years, from the moment I learned about the triangle rule when disassembling a dysfunctional mega-menu

Viewing Twenty Thirteen on Google TV, there is no side padding on the main title or navigation when zoomed in (which is default). The added padding in the media query doesn't apply. If padding was added to the base styles instead, it would adjust nicely.

May I ask to implement Hakre’s patch? The patch is really trivial, and I can see no side effects.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For a user on the other hand, the result is not intuitive. There is also no hint available for the user how she can fix it.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Thanks for your testing and detailed feedback. Here are some responses to your specific points:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="upperalpha"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thanks for catching that issue with the autosaves, not sure the best way to fix as you mentioned its an ajax save and the logic about showing the meta box happens at page load (are there x revisions for this post?).
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol class="upperalpha" start="2"&gt;&lt;li&gt;1. JS off - this is a JS/Backbone rewrite of revisions and no-js has not been addressed at all. not sure what the approach will be, either no support or fallback to old code. 2. you shouldn't even be able to get to the revisions page unless you have at least two revisions
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="upperalpha" start="3"&gt;&lt;li&gt;that should NOT happen as you mention. if you change one line in each revision, that line change should be visible in each diff. if you can reproduce, please tell me steps.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol class="upperalpha" start="4"&gt;&lt;li&gt;reverting a post may mess with the revisions page, aware of the issue. part of the problem is that currently the most recent revision represents the previous update, not the current post data - except after a restore. we are addressing this issue in &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16215" title="#16215: defect (bug): Post Revision history displays the incorrect author (closed: fixed)"&gt;#16215&lt;/a&gt; and once that patch rolls i believe the logic will be cleaner.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;from your description though, wouldn't 'four' show in any position? note that &lt;em&gt;the diff view in single handle mode shows what has changed between the current version and the selected revision&lt;/em&gt;. if the current version contains the 'four' edit, that will show on the +Added side of the diff for every revision comparison. again:  the view shows compare to current, not what happened in the revision (i tried it that way, but it wasn't liked)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ol class="upperalpha" start="5"&gt;&lt;li&gt;you are correct that no matter which revision link you click on, the revisions page always loads with the most recent revision selected; this is a known issue and will be addressed in an upcoming patch
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol class="upperalpha" start="6"&gt;&lt;li&gt;all comparisons are to the final revised post in one handle mode (currently actually uses post since no revision is available), thats the way the comparisons are currently set up. maybe we need to make that logic more apparent in the interface. also trying reversing the order so newest revisions are on the right
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol class="upperalpha" start="7"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Agreed 'Restore Revision' button is super confusing. in my upcoming patch you will see we changed what that button says 'Restore This Revision' and placement- next to the compare to revision data, hopefully making it clearer what happens when you click the button. i think my screencast may display a bug with which revision was restored, i'm looking into that.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;
really appreciate the feedback and testing, obviously some kinks to work out! i should have another patch on the ticket early next week and could use more testing help if you are willing...
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;did you do this test using the latest trunk? the code was updated recently and some of this sounds like buggy behavior that was fixed, please try with latest updates to see if you still have the issues; i was not able to reproduce the bug you described creating a new post and revising it --  the revisions screen worked as expected (although with the direction reversed)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I just did some testing in (completely) up-to-date SVN trunk, and I don't know how you didn't see errors because I spotted *several* problems right away. Both in my own testing, and in your own video.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="upperalpha"&gt;&lt;li&gt;When creating a new post or page (with JS turned on), there are no revisions of the post, so the "Revisions" screen option isn't even available unless you have two revisions. The problem here is that if the second revision is an autosave (from JS), the revisions still don't show up on the edit screen like they do when you publish a second revision since it doesn't actually post the entire page, it's just an AJAX request (this might be an old problem though). This isn't a big deal since compare doesn't work at all with only one non-autosave revision anyway, however, this points me to a second problem...
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol class="upperalpha" start="2"&gt;&lt;li&gt;(with JS off) When opening a page or post with one revision and an additional autosave revision, the "Revisions" widget on the edit page lists the revisions (properly), but with links to compare, which end up on a blank compare page with no explanation about what happened, but there's actually two problems here. First, JS was off, so it just doesn't load anything, hence the blank page. Second, if JS is actually on, it *does* load a comparison with only one revision, but you're saying that shouldn't even be possible without at least two non-autosave revisions to compare - but it happens (and in fact, it's actually correct about the revision info, and the comparison diff content for once surprisingly - hey, creation of a page/post is an edit from nothing to something and even Wikipedia and all VCS diff apps will show a diff on that).
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol class="upperalpha" start="3"&gt;&lt;li&gt;As hinted to in (B), the diff content is entirely incorrect in several different situations (which I am finding tough to consistently reproduce, however, one bug or another keeps popping up with *every* single test I do, I just don't always know which one is next - so they aren't hard to spot). In one case, with 3 non-autosave revisions each only changing one line, and with only one line of content, I have been able to get the comparison to somehow end up with *two* lines of content from two different revisions on the same side of the diff, one line right after the other. That should definitely never happen. Fix the other bugs mentioned here first, and then it might be easier to reproduce and squash this bug (I'll come back again later to test again I'm sure).
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol class="upperalpha" start="4"&gt;&lt;li&gt;I did one test (without autosaves) where I created a post with "one", updated with "two", reverted to "one" (which worked), and updated the post with "four" (since it's the fourth revision), and while in comparison view (no matter how I got there from any revision), if the slider is on any of the revisions, it always showed "four" as being added even though it was only added in the last revision.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the 'compare two revisions' should not be available if there are fewer than three revisions
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This could be a little hard to test since it's tough to ensure an autosave doesn't sneak in right now, maybe just disable JS while testing (and re-enable on compare). That may have happened in Mike's test. In my own testing, I never did see the "compare two revisions" option unless I had at least 3 revisions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
here is a screen recording of my test trying to reproduce the error you outline: &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://cl.ly/NQb0"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://cl.ly/NQb0&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are definitely errors right here in your own video...
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="upperalpha" start="5"&gt;&lt;li&gt;After you save the "revise" content, you clicked on the "22:03:08" revision, which was the oldest and first revision, however, the comparison page always opens on the latest revision first every time (which in your case was the "22:03:11" revision - from "test" to "revise").
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol class="upperalpha" start="6"&gt;&lt;li&gt;The first time you move the slider to the right, it says it's comparing the oldest "22:03:08" revision, which should have been the change from nothing to "test", not from nothing to "revise" - in fact, this removed/added combo *never* happens in any single revision - that's only if you compared two revisions from the non-existent post to the final "revise" post.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol class="upperalpha" start="7"&gt;&lt;li&gt;When you click "restore revision", this is super confusing... what are you restoring? If it was the oldest revision's content, shouldn't your content have been "test" and not an empty post? Why was your content completely empty, but the title wasn't? If you click "restore" with the latest revision selected, doesn't that actually mean that nothing should happen? Shouldn't the restore button be disabled on the latest revision diff?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is a fantastic read: &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://bjk5.com/post/44698559168/breaking-down-amazons-mega-dropdown"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://bjk5.com/post/44698559168/breaking-down-amazons-mega-dropdown&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And it resulted in an MIT-licensed jQuery plugin that we should absolutely consider using to improve our menus: &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/kamens/jQuery-menu-aim"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://github.com/kamens/jQuery-menu-aim&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Also, the "proper" way to patch this using the include-only-what-is-needed suggestion would be to place these these require_once calls directly at the top of media_sideload_image(). It'd be weird to do that for only this function, though.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
If you want to use an admin function on the frontend, the only proper way to do that is to include wp-admin/includes/admin.php. Otherwise you risk breakage from wp-admin movement, and I'm not responsible for that.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think this is a function worthy of wp-includes. But, as it stands now, it is an unwieldy function. I'd like to introduce something a little better if we're going to shift it. There is a ticket from alexkingorg regarding this function.
&lt;/p&gt;

I put a quick proof of concept together, essentially checking that any of  the user(s) about to be deleted have any kind of post, and if they don't,  just show a hidden input to run the default delete action on the next step, rather than re-assign.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I also put a check on the jQuery in the header, that if that hidden field exists, it doesn't disable the submit button.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'm not sure if a text line with words to the effect of "This user has no posts that need to be dealt with" - incase they are expecting those two options.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
When deleting one or many users, I don't think it makes sense, and is an unnecessary click to ask someone what to do with their posts if they haven't made any.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It's a tiny time saver for administrators.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Probably no need for so many functions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is similar to slurping images / galleries from a content blob. There are so many different ways it can be in there, we need 6 extraction functions, and here they are:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;get_post_audio()&lt;/code&gt; - wraps &lt;code&gt;get_children()&lt;/code&gt;, returns attached audio, impl'd in &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/23282" title="#23282: feature request: Add shortcodes for inline HTML5 audio / video (closed: fixed)"&gt;#23282&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;get_post_video()&lt;/code&gt; - wraps &lt;code&gt;get_children()&lt;/code&gt;, returns attached video, impl'd in &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/23282" title="#23282: feature request: Add shortcodes for inline HTML5 audio / video (closed: fixed)"&gt;#23282&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;get_content_audio()&lt;/code&gt; - slurps shortcodes out of the passed content and returns a list of lists: each shortcode can have multiple &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;source&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;s (the primary audio &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;source&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and its fallbacks)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;get_content_video()&lt;/code&gt; - slurps shortcodes out of the passed content and returns a list of lists: each shortcode can have multiple &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;source&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;s (the primary video &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;source&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and its fallbacks)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;get_embedded_audio()&lt;/code&gt; - returns a list: slurps embed HTML (&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;object&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;embed&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;iframe&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;) and HTML5 &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;audio&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags out of content, or if the content is a URL or starts with a URL, returns that as well
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;get_embedded_video()&lt;/code&gt; - returns a list: slurps embed HTML (&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;object&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;embed&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;iframe&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;) and HTML5 &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;video&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags out of content, or if the content is a URL or starts with a URL, returns that as well
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Patch updated. Unit Tests forthcoming.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Is it really such a good idea to put the padding where it is currently in the error pages? This causes all sorts of problems with Dom parsers... it should be placed somewhere after the html tag or better yet in the body... almost looks like someone is very proud of their fix and wants the world to see it lol
&lt;/p&gt;

I'm not seeing duplicate "Date" headers in emails in either 3.5 or 3.6. Can you please elaborate on what data you are passing to wp_mail() and also inspect which filters you have added for "wp_mail"?
&lt;/p&gt;

Replying to &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/23724#comment:1" title="Comment 1"&gt;SergeyBiryukov&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I've found 14 instances of applying &lt;code&gt;the_title&lt;/code&gt; filter in current trunk. Changing it in one place would be inconsistent, so this should be done a separate ticket. Previous inconsistencies (passing only one parameter) were fixed in &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/13558" title="#13558: defect (bug): the_title should always pass $post-&amp;gt;ID as 2nd param (closed: fixed)"&gt;#13558&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16688" title="#16688: defect (bug): Inconsistent 'the_title' filter (closed: fixed)"&gt;#16688&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I hadn't considered these. Agree adding anything to 'the_title' should be consistent. Will repatch with that bit. Thanks for the heads up there.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
foreach warning due to unpopulated $mimes array and denial of uploads even when file types defined in network admin settings. This seems to happen because there is a disconnect between the defaults and what is actually present in the db (before the first save).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Should be noted that the site was installed programmatically using wp_install() so this may have something to do with it. I am giving this a major severity because the server path is disclosed from the foreach warning and the least that should be done is do an is_array() check on that $mime var and give a meaningful message stating that there are no mimes defined or something...
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #23724 (Pass $post into 'protected_title_format' and 'private_title_format' filters) updated</title>
      
        <dc:creator>SergeyBiryukov</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Sat, 09 Mar 2013 02:36:43 GMT</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;i&gt;Version&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I noticed also that we don't pass $post into the 'the_title' filter, which could cut down on an additional get_post() call later if we pass it here. Obviously not essential, but wouldn't hurt.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I've found 14 instances of applying &lt;code&gt;the_title&lt;/code&gt; filter in current trunk. Changing it in one place would be inconsistent, so this should be done a separate ticket. Previous inconsistencies (passing only one parameter) were fixed in &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/13558" title="#13558: defect (bug): the_title should always pass $post-&amp;gt;ID as 2nd param (closed: fixed)"&gt;#13558&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16688" title="#16688: defect (bug): Inconsistent 'the_title' filter (closed: fixed)"&gt;#16688&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Passing &lt;code&gt;$post&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;protected_title_format&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;private_title_format&lt;/code&gt; makes sense to me.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
once the functions exist in the WP, we can do another sweep to see if meta is necessary - also, if the UI vibes change to make meta more desirable, we can change the funcs
&lt;/p&gt;

Replying to &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/23497#comment:60" title="Comment 60"&gt;adamsilverstein&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;did you do this test using the latest trunk? the code was updated recently and some of this sounds like buggy behavior that was fixed, please try with latest updates to see if you still have the issues; i was not able to reproduce the bug you described creating a new post and revising it --  the revisions screen worked as expected (although with the direction reversed)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I just did some testing in (completely) up-to-date SVN trunk, and I don't know how you didn't see errors because I spotted *several* problems right away. Both in my own testing, and in your own video.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="upperalpha"&gt;&lt;li&gt;When creating a new post or page (with JS turned on), there are no revisions of the post, so the "Revisions" screen option isn't even available unless you have two revisions. The problem here is that if the second revision is an autosave (from JS), the revisions still don't show up on the edit screen like they do when you publish a second revision since it doesn't actually post the entire page, it's just an AJAX request (this might be an old problem though). This isn't a big deal since compare doesn't work at all with only one non-autosave revision anyway, however, this points me to a second problem...
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol class="upperalpha" start="2"&gt;&lt;li&gt;(with JS off) When opening a page or post with one revision and an additional autosave revision, the "Revisions" widget on the edit page lists the revisions (properly), but with links to compare, which end up on a blank compare page with no explanation about what happened, but there's actually two problems here. First, JS was off, so it just doesn't load anything, hence the blank page. Second, if JS is actually on, it *does* load a comparison with only one revision, but you're saying that shouldn't even be possible without at least two non-autosave revisions to compare - but it happens (and in fact, it's actually correct about the revision info, and the comparison diff content for once surprisingly - hey, creation of a page/post is an edit from nothing to something and even Wikipedia and all VCS diff apps will show a diff on that).
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol class="upperalpha" start="3"&gt;&lt;li&gt;As hinted to in (B), the diff content is entirely incorrect in several different situations (which I am finding tough to consistently reproduce, however, one bug or another keeps popping up with *every* single test I do, I just don't always know which one is next - so they aren't hard to spot). In one case, with 3 non-autosave revisions each only changing one line, and with only one line of content, I have been able to get the comparison to somehow end up with *two* lines of content from two different revisions on the same side of the diff, one line right after the other. That should definitely never happen. Fix the other bugs mentioned here first, and then it might be easier to reproduce and squash this bug (I'll come back again later to test again I'm sure).
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol class="upperalpha" start="4"&gt;&lt;li&gt;I did one test (without autosaves) where I created a post with "one", updated with "two", reverted to "one" (which worked), and updated the post with "four" (since it's the fourth revision), and while in comparison view (no matter how I got there from any revision), if the slider is on any of the revisions, it always showed "four" as being added even though it was only added in the last revision.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the 'compare two revisions' should not be available if there are fewer than three revisions
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This could be a little hard to test since it's tough to ensure an autosave doesn't sneak in right now, maybe just disable JS while testing (and re-enable on compare). That may have happened in Mike's test. In my own testing, I never did see the "compare two revisions" option unless I had at least 3 revisions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
here is a screen recording of my test trying to reproduce the error you outline: &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://cl.ly/NQb0"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://cl.ly/NQb0&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are definitely errors right here in your own video...
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="upperalpha" start="5"&gt;&lt;li&gt;After you save the "revise" content, you clicked on the "22:03:08" revision, which was the oldest and first revision, however, the comparison page always opens on the latest revision first every time (which in your case was the "22:03:11" revision - from "test" to "revise").
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol class="upperalpha" start="6"&gt;&lt;li&gt;The first time you move the slider to the right, it says it's comparing the oldest "22:03:08" revision, which should have been the change from nothing to "test", not from nothing to "revise" - in fact, this removed/added combo *never* happens in any single revision - that's only if you compared two revisions from the non-existent post to the final "revise" post.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol class="upperalpha" start="7"&gt;&lt;li&gt;When you click "restore revision", this is super confusing... what are you restoring? If it was the oldest revision's content, shouldn't your content have been "test" and not an empty post? Why was your content completely empty, but the title wasn't? If you click "restore" with the latest revision selected, doesn't that actually mean that nothing should happen? Shouldn't the restore button be disabled on the latest revision diff?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</description>
