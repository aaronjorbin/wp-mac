It's not about screen readers or any other assistive technology, it's about people. If you watch the &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12423#comment:82" title="Comment 82"&gt;test videos&lt;/a&gt;, you'll see that people are blocked from completing tasks by the changes you are advocating for.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you disagree so strongly with the importance of creating a product that is usable by everyone regardless of disability, you may wish to find other open source projects to contribute to. There are plenty of other open source projects that are less focused on being usable by all.
&lt;/p&gt;

Hi @Darko-A7 and welcome to Trac,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is by design - &lt;code&gt;?p=123&lt;/code&gt; will redirect to the correct location for post_id 123 regardless of if it's a post, page, attachment or custom post type.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you're not seeing that redirect happen for you, it sounds like there's something else at play here preventing that, and that's what you should be looking at for debugging.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For reference, here's a live site performing as expected: &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://dd32.id.au/?p=8319"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://dd32.id.au/?p=8319&lt;/a&gt; (redirects to the page)
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Aaron, we've been through all of this above. Here's the gist of the situation with code editors:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Visual highlighting is not of much use for screen reader users. Hence visual code editors authors don't bother much with WCAG 2.0. They know screen reader editor users are better served by plain text code editors or plain text code editors with some additional functionality.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Logically, WordPress should do the same. Put in the visual code editor for those of us who can use it AND at the same time improve the plain text code editor so it better meets the needs of screen reader editors. Particularly when it's very easy to allow people to choose which tool suits them better.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I know you are a clever man so it seems to me pointing to the accessibility guidelines is a deliberate attempt to obscure the issue. I don't disagree with the core of the guidelines. In this case, we can have our cake and eat it too. Both sides will be better served by offering specific and better tools to each side.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I've even agreed that over time we should do additional work on upgrading accessibility within CodeMirror. Perhaps eventually we will be able to make it do both functions at the same time (enhanced visual code editing, enhanced screen reader editing). From what I've seen (I've followed this conversation very closely and done some experimenting on my own) setting this as a priori is a very steep hill to climb and basically dooms us to poor quality editing tools for almost forever.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Not separating the code editing tools in this case would be a lose-lose situation.
&lt;/p&gt;

Just looking at the text field piece of that mockup (and ignoring the interaction enhancements), it seems there are two components that set it apart from what is there now: Line numbers and syntax highlighting. Is that correct?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Correct, along with auto-tabbing. In an ideal world, we'd also add auto-closing brackets, and maybe some basic syntax/error checking.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
if so, those two things could be looked at separately and we might be able to find accessible ways to implement both.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That's good enough for me.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
original forum topic is here:
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/shows-post-url-form-instead-for-page/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://wordpress.org/support/topic/shows-post-url-form-instead-for-page/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In short: created "page" inside WP Admin &amp;gt; Pages menu, and in it's source code the shortlink displayed is wrong (using form for posts, instead of pages):
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
wrong:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;&amp;lt;link rel='shortlink' href='https://mywebsite.com/?p=995' /&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
correct:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;&amp;lt;link rel='shortlink' href='https://mywebsite.com/?page_id=995' /&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
proposed fix:
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://wordpress.org/support/reply/8941661/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://wordpress.org/support/reply/8941661/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
original code:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;if ( 'page' === $post-&amp;gt;post_type &amp;amp;&amp;amp; $post-&amp;gt;ID == get_option( 'page_on_front' ) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; 'page' == get_option( 'show_on_front' ) ) {
$shortlink = home_url( '/' );
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
should be:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;if ( 'page' === $post-&amp;gt;post_type ) {
$shortlink = home_url( '?page_id=' . $post_id );
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
No longer get 404 from the shortlink url @ page's source code.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thanks!

Here's my positive proposal: I'd like to see us integrate CodeMirror (not my first choice, I preferred ACE originally) and simultaneously improve the plain text editor to add the top three features for assistive device users.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If your goal is to use a specific library, I would encourage you to spend your time ensuring that it passes the WCAG 2.0 AA standards. At that time, it seems like something we can consider.  Until then, you are proposing that WordPress should violate the standards it set for itself a little over a year ago (and that zero people objected to when proposed). If you would like to propose that the standards be different, the &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/01/24/accessibility-coding-standards-now-in-draft-and-seeking-comments/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;original post&lt;/a&gt; has comments open.

Aaron, if we are going to add syntax highlighting for the CSS editor, why on earth would we not implement it for the main code editor? You have me very confused at this point.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Working with code anywhere in WordPress is a "far from optimal experience". Let's fix it everywhere.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
My concern is primarily around improving the CSS Editor in the Customizer. It is, quite honestly, a painful experience currently. Going between writing some CSS on WordPress.com and writing some on my self-hosted sites is not fun. The mockup here: &lt;a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/38707/customizer-css-i2.png"&gt;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/38707/customizer-css-i2.png&lt;/a&gt; is very clearly an improvement on the existing CSS editor in core. It makes CSS easier to read, write, and maintain.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Anecdotally, Jetpack's CSS editor is something I constantly recommend at local tech community project nights, where the vast majority of people I help tend to be beginners making WordPress websites. They're generally either currently learning, or already comfortable with, CSS. I'd like to be able to recommend using core's CSS editor, but I can't, because it's a significantly worse experience. I'd like to be able to use it for myself, instead of immediately reaching for Jetpack.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Having a way to edit CSS in core is waaaay better than nothing, but it needs to be improved.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Having just used the CSS editor on a site, I agree that it's far from an optimal experience. I also agree that when I chat with end users and site builders, it's something they find beneficial (but not super easy to use without some more advanced knowledge).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Just looking at the text field piece of that mockup (and ignoring the interaction enhancements), it seems there are two components that set it apart from what is there now: Line numbers and syntax highlighting. Is that correct?  if so, those two things could be looked at separately and we might be able to find accessible ways to implement both.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Thank you for your input, Andrea. Measured argument was attempted earlier (please see my earlier comments). When a sensible (but unwelcome) consensus was reached via open discussion, there were closed door meetings held. From here it looks like those at those meetings then decided as a group to close this ticket.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Tag team discouragement from core committers is no more welcome among the community than sarcasm from junior members. The disastrous current code editor is overripe for replacement (seven years overripe). Suggesting that a decent code editor along with reliable shifting between visual edit view and code edit view is not a highly desired feature doesn't sound very likely to me.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now of course if the goal is to kick the can down the road so that any new code editor has to come in Calypso or in order to enjoy a modern editor a  user must to install Jetpack, you and Aaron and Rian have put in a very good day's work today. Personally I believe in a powerful and modern core WordPress which can stand on its independent legs, not in maintaining crippleware for Automattic to turn into SAAS. Good editing tools for me are definitely not "plugin material". This is core capability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
From what I understand our goals align on that point. But a strong independent WordPress means an up to date and capable WordPress. We are supposed to be on the same side. The underlying point is that the current editing tools in WordPress do not belong in a modern CMS nor should assistive device users have to struggle along with a tool focused on non-assistive device users (the current text editor which provides an all-round poor experience for everyone).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here's my positive proposal: I'd like to see us integrate CodeMirror (not my first choice, I preferred ACE originally) and simultaneously improve the plain text editor to add the top three features for assistive device users.

I forgot I wrote the patch in the first place!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The patch I have doesn't change the CSS, just assigns &lt;code&gt;button-primary&lt;/code&gt; to the buttons (that's 29875.2.diff) so if you want the CSS to move the buttons to the left then that's a different change which I haven't done, and I'm not sure where we'd want to put that.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I added 29875.3.diff which is based off trunk, and that just makes the buttons primary again.
&lt;/p&gt;

I think when you're on a page with no widget areas, but your theme has them on other pages, we should drop the "other" and still say:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Your theme has [x] widget areas, but this particular page doesn’t display them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Edit: In addition to the other paragraph :)

Setting it to 100% will cause all buttons to disappear if div with class &lt;code&gt;media-toolbar-secondary&lt;/code&gt; is filled in with anything on all screens.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

@Cybr I don't quite understand your comment, what do you mean by " if div with class &lt;code&gt;media-toolbar-secondary&lt;/code&gt; is filled in with anything", can you give an example or steps to reproduce?

&lt;code&gt;notice-alt&lt;/code&gt; is only for white backgrounds. On grey backgrounds, it blends in with the page. I'll upload a version that uses the regular notice class, for comparison.

I'm fine either way re: italics on the filename. It's probably there to provide more hierarchy, but it between the color and the size I think it's fine without being italic.
&lt;/p&gt;

So the end point is to get coverage reports so if this work then we are good
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The error is due to print statements e.g. "Installing..." there is a bug ticket for that we need away to turn it off for coverage reports.
&lt;/p&gt;

Next step is to get a patch ready for commit.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
@Ipstenu Do you want update your existing patch, if it doesn't match @Travel_girl's mockups?

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
My concern is primarily around improving the CSS Editor in the Customizer. It is, quite honestly, a painful experience currently. Going between writing some CSS on WordPress.com and writing some on my self-hosted sites is not fun. The mockup here: &lt;a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/38707/customizer-css-i2.png"&gt;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/38707/customizer-css-i2.png&lt;/a&gt; is very clearly an improvement on the existing CSS editor in core. It makes CSS easier to read, write, and maintain.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Anecdotally, Jetpack's CSS editor is something I constantly recommend at local tech community project nights, where the vast majority of people I help tend to be beginners making WordPress websites. They're generally either currently learning, or already comfortable with, CSS. I'd like to be able to recommend using core's CSS editor, but I can't, because it's a significantly worse experience. I'd like to be able to use it for myself, instead of immediately reaching for Jetpack.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Having a way to edit CSS in core is waaaay better than nothing, but it needs to be improved.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Reading closer, the &lt;code&gt;@covers&lt;/code&gt; annotation is a &lt;strong&gt;supplement&lt;/strong&gt; to this automated coverage, and I don't think you can generate a report from manual annotations only.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
@jorbin has already set this up:  &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://daily.jorb.in/2015/10/automated-code-coverage-of-wordpress-core-php-code/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://daily.jorb.in/2015/10/automated-code-coverage-of-wordpress-core-php-code/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The basic way to run it is as follows, but I get a mysterious error when I do so:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;$ phpunit --coverage-html coverage-dir

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Attempting to enqueue a .css file to style admin area elements using the following results in a unresponsive "screen options" button:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;function load_admin_style() {
  wp_enqueue_style('admin_css', get_template_directory_uri() . '/library/css/style.css');
}
add_action( 'admin_enqueue_scripts', 'load_admin_style' );
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The .css is present and loaded correctly however.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
---
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Using wp_enqueue_script() results in both the .css file and the other js being loaded correctly:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;function load_admin_style() {
  wp_enqueue_script('admin_css', get_template_directory_uri() . '/library/css/style.css');
}
add_action( 'admin_enqueue_scripts', 'load_admin_style' );

@chesio,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thanks for providing the patch.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Although the patch works, it doesn't meet the &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/php/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;WordPress PHP coding standards&lt;/a&gt; which require spaces inside the brackets, ie &lt;code&gt;array( 'jquery' )&lt;/code&gt;. The coding standards are in place to make reading the code easier for future developers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I've marked the patch as needing a refresh and to be fixed in the next release.
&lt;/p&gt;

@FolioVision @WraithKenny the discussion on this ticket is full of personal opinions (always welcomed) &lt;em&gt;without any actual data&lt;/em&gt; to support them. I'd strongly encourage to prove with data the real need for a syntax highlighting feature which, by the way, it's not the only feature CodeMirror has. I'm open to change my mind when someone can prove CodeMirror would be appreciated and actually used by 80% or more of end users.
As I see it, these kind of comments don't add any positive value to the discussion and just repeat thoughts already expressed on previous comments.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Also, comments that sound like personal attacks ("You can't be serious?"), or terms like "crap", or sarcasm, are not welcome here.

@Travel_girl you're welcome to join the discussion on &lt;a class="assigned ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31818" title="#31818: enhancement: Uniform Search Form Display/Experience (assigned)"&gt;#31818&lt;/a&gt;, to be honest there's no progress on that ticket since a while but it's definitely on the accessibility team radar. Also, a11y meetings happen on Mondays at 18 UTC if you're interested :)
I'd say the best way to search previous tickets on Trac is using Google, prepending the search with &lt;code&gt;site:core.trac.wordpress.org&lt;/code&gt; as the Trac search results are often not so ideal.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I can't tell if there's a reason the template uses &lt;code&gt;data.attachment.sizes.full.url&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;data.attachment.url&lt;/code&gt;. Looking at &lt;a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/src/wp-includes/media.php#L3192"&gt;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/src/wp-includes/media.php#L3192&lt;/a&gt;, it appears that both will have the same value in this context.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I like &lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/40010/40010.1.diff" title="Attachment '40010.1.diff' in Ticket #40010"&gt;attachment:40010.1.diff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/40010/40010.1.diff" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt; for the fallback, or even just using &lt;code&gt;data.attachment.url&lt;/code&gt; in the first place.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since it's trivial to remove the full-size, it would be nice if the assumption of its presence wasn't made.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Hi,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I run into an "jQuery is not defined" issue with Twenty Seventeen when I try to re-queue jQuery into footer, because &lt;em&gt;/assets/js/navigation.js&lt;/em&gt; is enqueued without jQuery as dependency.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Fix is simple, I've attached a patch.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Cheers,
Česlav

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Aaron (@jorbin), the current editor is horribly out of date scrap code which is totally uninspiring and hardly usable. No wonder no one uses it. As you noted, the amount of energy going into the Medium-copycat visual editor is enormous (fancy names like Gutenberg don't make it any more original). The work done there is no excuse for not integrating a high quality code editor like CodeMirror which is a relatively easy task.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
WordPress users have been waiting seven years for a better code editor. The people participating in this conversation didn't invest their time and focus now just to have a core committer try to sweep the mess under the carpet again.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
@rianrietveld You wrote:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We are changing a key interface on the platform, users have expectations about how things work and are now confronted with a complete different design. This not only affects users with assistive technology, but all users of the Text interface.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You can't be serious? Do you think there are any sighted users of the WordPress code editor who could not figure out how to use highlighted syntax? That's the main gain with a better code editor. And small visual and functional tweaks here and there. Syntax highlighting is an &lt;strong&gt;immediate improvement&lt;/strong&gt; in usability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yes, a code editor with visually highlighted syntax does nothing for users with assistive technology. Hence the current plain text editor should get enhancements as discussed in depth above with @zersiax.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So it's really come down to there are some people with limited vision (or no vision), therefore the rest of us will get no visual cues when editing. It's something like insisting that as athletes with legs have an advantage over athletes without legs, we are now going to cut everybody's legs off. I deliberately avoided making such a comparison earlier as we should all be able to work together without undercutting one another's work or software experience. We should work &lt;strong&gt;together&lt;/strong&gt; to add a code editor with visual highlights AND at the same time enhance the plain text code editor for those who use screen readers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Surely the unrelenting focus of the accessible group is not to bring everything down to lowest common denominator?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It's funny you bring up distraction free mode.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The new interface is useful but should not be implemented by default, we have to inform users of the new interface with an opt-in to use it. So the new interface should not be switched on by default but selected in the settings, for example now with distraction-free mode.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Distraction free mode needs to be enabled every time you want to use it and is more a distraction than a help. Everyone hates it. Where the switch needs to be is in user preferences next to the Visual Code Editor checkbox  where there should be a clear option to choose either:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;text based code editor enhanced for assistive devices.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;visual code editor with syntax highlighting.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I know ahead of time which version 99% of users would find more useful. So do you. Numbers aren't everything: it doesn't mean that the enhancements to the text based code editor are any less important. Still numbers and utility &lt;strong&gt;are&lt;/strong&gt; something.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With @afercia's intervention I see there is a concerted effort from core to leave WordPress users with a really crap code editor. Do our core principles include:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;staying almost decades behind state of the art interfaces
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;not taking advantage of the hard work of other open source project (Mozilla's Ace, CodeMirror)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a not made here mentality (if we don't code it from scratch, we're not interested)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I cannot believe programmers are writing with a straight face that syntax highlighted code editor view is not a significant improvement (it would be perhaps the most significant improvement in WordPress &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://foliovision.com/2016/12/wordpress-improvements"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;in the last three iterations&lt;/a&gt;, after retina image support in 4.4).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let's try and get this show back on the road in a positive way. The time has more than come for syntax highlighting in code view in WordPress. The time has more than come to retire wpautop and for code integrity when switching between visual and code mode in WordPress. It would be great to join the post-2010 CMS and editing world. It's 2017 already, mesdames et messieurs.
&lt;/p&gt;

Hi @jnylen0
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
How would we go about providing automated code coverage reports on a line-by-line basis? This would good but can it be done?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A good test will only be testing one function so I expect to see just one @covers per test.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We went through the code base and add comments to actions and filters this a smaller task and we already have volunteers to do the heavy lifting who just waiting for the OK to get started
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

For the about page you need to log in first, that takes more time and I don't have all the logins.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You could check the HTML source of front-end pages, the version should be present in the &lt;code&gt;generator&lt;/code&gt; meta tag. It's also appended to JS scripts for cache busting, e.g. &lt;code&gt;wp-emoji.js?ver=4.6.3&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In my staging environment (I am testing 4.7.3), I see no place that says more than 4.7 in the view-source of the front page. This presents a enterprise problem as I need to be able to show that I have performed the upgrade from 4.7.2 to 4.7.3. I just need to be able to expose the full version number to be able to allay security concerns.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
While I am definitely a proponent of thorough unit tests, I am -1 on adding annotations for code coverage, and in general I think the &lt;code&gt;@covers&lt;/code&gt; annotation is not a good idea.  I will try to explain why.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Someone will have to update every single test to indicate which functions are covered.  This will be a manual process requiring an enormous amount of effort, not only now, but in perpetuity.  I can't speak for everyone but I personally don't want to do this in my patches.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It is virtually guaranteed that tests will not be consistently updated with &lt;code&gt;@covers&lt;/code&gt; annotations in the future.  (It's hard enough to ensure that tests are written in the first place.)  Even if we do a huge effort now to add them, the coverage reports will become essentially useless in the future due to attrition.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Per-function coverage is not a very useful thing to report on.  Consider:  &lt;code&gt;@covers wp_update_post&lt;/code&gt;.  This is a very long function with a lot of complicated logic.  Line-by-line coverage reporting is far more useful.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don't want to read lots of lines of &lt;code&gt;@covers&lt;/code&gt; and other annotations in the test code.  I think we already have too many of these annotations and they are just visual noise, because the information about which functions are called is already present in the test code itself.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I would be far more interested in an effort to provide &lt;strong&gt;automated&lt;/strong&gt; code coverage reports on a line-by-line basis, perhaps with results split by WordPress component or something like that.  I do think this would be really valuable, and once it's set up, there's far less ongoing maintenance required.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #12423 (Include default code editor) updated</title>
      
        <dc:creator>afercia</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Tue, 21 Mar 2017 19:35:35 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12423#comment:91</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12423#comment:91/1490124935442496</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I'd second @jorbin's proposal to close this ticket as maybelater. Apart from the technical issues we've proven with real testing, I'd also like to add some general considerations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Just my 2 cents of course, but I think this kind of decisions should be based on actual data. I haven't seen &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; data to support the introduction of a code editor with syntax highlighting. The only rationale mentioned was that the introduction of this feature was "raised during the Q&amp;amp;A at SOTW". Aside: please expand abbreviations since not all the people reading this ticket may know what "SOTW" (State Of The Word, during WordCamp US 2016 I guess) means.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'd argue the audience at the State Of The Word is really representative of the WordPress user base, since it's typically made of people with good technical knowledge or, at least, by advanced WordPress users.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At the risk of sounding a bit pedantic, I'd also like to remind some of the points of the WordPress philosophy, as it seems, as developers, we sometimes tend to forget them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://wordpress.org/about/philosophy"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://wordpress.org/about/philosophy&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Design for the Majority&lt;/strong&gt;
Many end users of WordPress are &lt;strong&gt;non-technically minded&lt;/strong&gt;. They don’t know what AJAX is, nor do they care about which version of PHP they are using. The average WordPress user simply wants to be able to write without problems or interruption. &lt;strong&gt;These are the users that we design the software for&lt;/strong&gt; as they are ultimately the ones who are going to spend the most time using it for what it was built for.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Clean, Lean, and Mean&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The core of WordPress will always provide a solid array of basic features. It’s designed to be lean and fast and will always stay that way&lt;/strong&gt;. We are constantly asked "when will X feature be built" or "why isn’t X plugin integrated into the core". The rule of thumb is that the &lt;strong&gt;core should provide features that 80% or more of end users will actually appreciate and use&lt;/strong&gt;. If the next version of WordPress comes with a feature that the majority of users immediately want to turn off, or think they’ll never use, then we’ve blown it. If we stick to the 80% principle then this should never happen.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Apart from accessibility-related considerations, I personally feel the feature proposed on this ticket doesn't fit with these principles and therefore I'd consider it plugin territory.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While progressive JPEGs can be smaller, they are not always desired from an aesthetics standpoint.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yes! FOUT anyone? Now FOUP. Flash of Unstyled Picture...
Progressive JPGs alter the aesthetic experience of a site. And while it may be something for a site owner to consider, it should be their choice on whether to utilize or not.
Similarly, lazy loaders are not baked into Core.
The psychology of how people interact with progressive jpegs can be read here:
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://www.webperformancetoday.com/2014/09/17/progressive-image-rendering-good-evil/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://www.webperformancetoday.com/2014/09/17/progressive-image-rendering-good-evil/&lt;/a&gt;
TL;DR: the brain has to figure out what they're loooking at when they see a blurry image, then acknowledge what the object actually is when it's finally rendered. (This is very much in contrast with the Don't Make Me Think philosophy).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I could see this potentially as an option in the Media settings, but then you're dealing with regenerating all the jpegs (and doing the same when/if switching back).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is something a site owner should be responsible for IF they want to pursue it. And when the average Progressive JPG only saves a few percentage points, there are other areas to focus on. Lossless compression saves way more (25-60% in cases) than Progressive JPGs, without the aesthetic issues.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Progressive JPEGs have been around forever, but we have better technology that allows for a much superior user experience. You can't trade usability/experience for a small performance improvement, when there are better options now.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As a photographer, and as a internet user, I'm inclined to agree with Nacin, and not support this.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

+1
Quoting from the conversation on the GitHub PR:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Translators have to know the context and know the size of the string they choose. This could be indicated via the translators comment or via the $context parameter in the translation function. This is what we did for the “Hide Controls” label in &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38762" title="#38762: defect (bug): Customizer &amp;#34;Hide Controls&amp;#34; Text Too long (closed: fixed)"&gt;#38762&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Even if translators pay attention to the context (and they often don't), in some languages this is simply not possible. As I see it, &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38762" title="#38762: defect (bug): Customizer &amp;#34;Hide Controls&amp;#34; Text Too long (closed: fixed)"&gt;#38762&lt;/a&gt; was a very special case to patch a design choice that wasn't so ideal in the first place and should be considered an exception.
&lt;/p&gt;

@afercia and @melchoyce thanks for the links and the explanation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I find the current background color not dark enough to have an highlight and I think just the border is not visible enough.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'm not sure with the italic. I think it makes the different between title and description a bit more clear.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Yep, the minimum contrast ratio we aim for is &lt;code&gt;4.5:1&lt;/code&gt; (level AA for normal text). About background and border, why not simply use the &lt;code&gt;notice notice-info notice-alt&lt;/code&gt; classes? Quickly tried without touching the text color, margin, padding, etc. that should be adjusted as suggested above, of course:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a style="padding:0; border:none" href="https://cldup.com/y2LYBpr3gq.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cldup.com/y2LYBpr3gq.png" alt="https://cldup.com/y2LYBpr3gq.png" crossorigin="anonymous" title="https://cldup.com/y2LYBpr3gq.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Also: is the italic style really necessary? To me, it's a bit disturbing and doesn't add any important information.
&lt;/p&gt;

This needs to be revisited. If someone wants to refresh the patch and look further into any complications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One thing to note: if a control gets removed from &lt;code&gt;wp.customize.control&lt;/code&gt; then it should probably be forbidden from being re-added, the deferreds will have already resolved and any attached event listeners would have been destroyed. That is, unless we use &lt;code&gt;jQuery#detatch&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;jQuery#remove&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
In the WordPress-Backend are multiple Search-fields and those are all different.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For a better User Experience it would be better, if their would look and work the same way.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Search for
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Posts
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pages
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Media
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Plugins
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Themes
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I suggest to have the search field in the upper right corner with an button "Search xy" like in the Post version. In this way it would be easier to navigate.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Also when you want to install new plugins or themes, while you are typing the keywords, the search starts automatically and have wrong results sometimes.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
@melchoyce looks good.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yes I also think the filename is not clear enough and the contrast between background and fourground is not high enhough for a good accessibility --&amp;gt; &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://www.etre.com/tools/colourcheck/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://www.etre.com/tools/colourcheck/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think the question is: how important is the different between filename and title. The filename can be darker, but I´m not sure, how different it would be to the title.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
AFAIK, we're only trying to pass AA, not AAA. 5.07:1 should be sufficient contrast: &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/accessibility-coding-standards/#color-contrast"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/accessibility-coding-standards/#color-contrast&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
@afercia can you chime in?
&lt;/p&gt;

        <dc:creator>desrosj</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Tue, 21 Mar 2017 17:42:42 GMT</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I found this ticket when working on &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40113" title="#40113: defect (bug): Change User Roles on Multisite (closed: fixed)"&gt;#40113&lt;/a&gt; which is related to changing roles for users in the edit site section of the network admin. Like @engelen detailed above with term bulk edit and user roles, this area could have potentially large negative consequences.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the edit site users dialogue in the network admin, the logic in the patch on &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40113" title="#40113: defect (bug): Change User Roles on Multisite (closed: fixed)"&gt;#40113&lt;/a&gt; (which was copied over from the single site user edit screen) will always respect the second dropdown field.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Say a person is at the bottom of the page and selects a role. Then they scroll up selecting users, and then select a different role in the dropdown at the top. The bottom dropdown value would be applied to all selected users. This could be very bad, and a huge pain if a large number of users had been selected. Especially if the user selects Administrator in the bottom dropdown, and then changes their mind at the top to a lesser role. All users would be promoted to Administrators.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To reproduce, select a role in the dropdown at the top of the table, and then select a different role in the bottom dropdown. Click change in either row, and the second dropdown is the value respected.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think for certain core fields (like role change, bulk edit), it would make sense to make these values always match.
&lt;/p&gt;

This has nothing to do with the visual editor changes (such as those being explored by gutenberg). By closing this and marking it maybelater, it allows energy to be focused there.
&lt;/p&gt;

This is because of new theme starter content feature integrated in 4.7,
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/11/30/starter-content-for-themes-in-4-7/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/11/30/starter-content-for-themes-in-4-7/&lt;/a&gt;
and I think it is executed only in Customizer, it should get executed on theme install too (without Live Preview)
&lt;/p&gt;

Looked through the commit history &lt;a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/trunk/src/wp-admin/network/site-users.php"&gt;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/trunk/src/wp-admin/network/site-users.php&lt;/a&gt;, this has not been working for at least 4 years, since the file was moved into &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;trunk&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This should get patched, but I will open a separate ticket for a broader discussion of about the top and bottom dropdown fields.

      <title>Ticket #40221 (switch_theme action + Live Preview = confusion) created</title>
      
        <dc:creator>alexvorn2</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Tue, 21 Mar 2017 17:09:49 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40221</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40221/1490116189128614</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
The switch_theme function has inside a hook named the same: switch_theme, it is used for theme deactivation actions, but the problem is that after you activate the theme via Live Preview - this action is executed, so can create confusion.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
(switch_theme hook is for theme deactivation functions - &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference/switch_theme"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference/switch_theme&lt;/a&gt;)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When we activate a theme (not via Live Preview) - then this hook is executed together with old theme, not with new theme, but when we have a Live Preview with a new theme, then this hook will be used with the theme that is inside the Live Preview, with it's files. That's why this hook is called incorrectly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So if this is not by design and it is a bug then the fix would be to skip this hook after a theme activation via Live Preview.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So if the current text one, is that going to be improved at all, since the text editor is still used a fair bit. I know the visual editor has &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I see, so you'd like to have the “other widget areas aren't shown” message to include all of: Your theme has 2 other widget areas, but this particular page doesn’t display them. You can navigate to other pages on your site while using the Customizer to view and edit the widgets displayed on those pages.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yup. Ideally, with a line break between the two sentences for a little breathing room; I know this is a lot of text in a pretty small space.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I very much like @michelleweber's suggested wording for now, and really look forward to reducing confusion even more by no longer hiding widget areas at all in a future iteration, as @melchoyce suggests. When we get to that point, we can always add any wording needed to prevent any chance of the opposite form of confusion arising.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>wontfix: &lt;p&gt;
Widgets can be arbitrarily complex. Many themes have very complicated widgets with non-trivial configurations. It is useful for being able to stash a widget for later reuse.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The inactive widgets area is required as well when switching themes, when widgets aren't able to be re-assigned to a sidebar.
&lt;/p&gt;

This came up in &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-core-media-widgets/pull/23"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://github.com/xwp/wp-core-media-widgets/pull/23&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We explored making the image widget buttons natural-width. I still think it's a good idea, but I'd like to explore it for all of the Customizer media control buttons, not just the image widget. Natural-width buttons are better for translations, and don't feel as overpowering as the half-width (and full-width) buttons.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Attaching examples.

With it seeming more and more like an accessible code editor isn't going to be a possibility, and &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/accessibility-coding-standards/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;the WordPress standards require that all new code conform to WCAG 2.0&lt;/a&gt;,  I think we should close this as maybelater and consider it plugin territory until such time as an editor that all users can use is available.

&lt;em&gt;( linking to &lt;code&gt;trunk&lt;/code&gt; is problematic, because those line numbers will invariably change in the future, and anyone who wants to look at the links will have to spend extra time to find the original ones )&lt;/em&gt;

Looks good @abhishekfdd. At full width, the search box stays smaller and pinned to the right side of the screen:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a style="padding:0; border:none" href="https://d3vv6lp55qjaqc.cloudfront.net/items/1Y061G2R2S0W0w1U2k1A/Image%202017-03-21%20at%2010.41.55%20AM.png?X-CloudApp-Visitor-Id=1371633"&gt;&lt;img src="https://d3vv6lp55qjaqc.cloudfront.net/items/1Y061G2R2S0W0w1U2k1A/Image%202017-03-21%20at%2010.41.55%20AM.png?X-CloudApp-Visitor-Id=1371633" alt="https://d3vv6lp55qjaqc.cloudfront.net/items/1Y061G2R2S0W0w1U2k1A/Image%202017-03-21%20at%2010.41.55%20AM.png" crossorigin="anonymous" title="https://d3vv6lp55qjaqc.cloudfront.net/items/1Y061G2R2S0W0w1U2k1A/Image%202017-03-21%20at%2010.41.55%20AM.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At smaller sizes the width snaps to 100%:
&lt;/p&gt;

I do not restore widgets from &lt;strong&gt;Inactive Widgets&lt;/strong&gt; (widget area), I just remove them all and Drag another 'new' one all the time, do you guys restore widgets? Not much settings can be stored in the widgets to be afraid of losing them. So if you lost a Calendar widget and Archive widget somehow (like removing a widget area) it is not big deal.
What are you thoughts?

I still believe hiding options from users is a really, really bad decision...
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I agree, and I think we can explore this further. Adding some copy is a quick improvement that can make it into the next point release, and it's a start. Removing contextual preview will take more time, work, and conversation. Let's try to do that over the next month or two.

      <description>invalid: &lt;p&gt;
Hi @rajamarshal, you closed the ticket as invalid so I assumed that you had realised the issue is unrelated to WordPress core.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There is no &lt;code&gt;Approve New Users&lt;/code&gt; functionality in WordPress core, so the issue you're seeing is most likely part of a plugin installed on your site. For example, you might be using the &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/new-user-approve/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;New User Approve plugin&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You should take a look to see which plugin you're using and then get in touch with the plugin author on the WordPress.org support forums.

Thanks, looks like the translations are wrong:

Pinging @casiepa and @daveloodts so they can fix it. Closing as invalid since this isn't a bug in core. Thanks for reporting the issue!

Hi @ocean90,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'm using the Dutch language in Wordpress (and it's the nl_BE version I've installed).
The only plugins I've installed are akismet and contact-form-7
&lt;/p&gt;

There are appearances like:
&lt;a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/src/wp-content/themes/twentyseventeen/footer.php#L25"&gt;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/src/wp-content/themes/twentyseventeen/footer.php#L25&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/src/wp-content/themes/twentyseventeen/template-parts/navigation/navigation-top.php#L12"&gt;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/src/wp-content/themes/twentyseventeen/template-parts/navigation/navigation-top.php#L12&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
_e() in these cases should actually be esc_attr_e() to ensure the translated string gets escaped for an HTML attribute context, because the translated string from another language could potentially have a character that would need to be escaped.
&lt;/p&gt;

Hello @dezilverhippie, welcome to Trac.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Are you using the Dutch language in WordPress or is it still English? I'm asking because this is controlled by two strings, see &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp/dev/nl/default?filters%5Bstatus%5D=either&amp;amp;filters%5Boriginal_id%5D=231192&amp;amp;filters%5Btranslation_id%5D=21600838"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp/dev/nl/default?filters%5Bstatus%5D=either&amp;amp;filters%5Boriginal_id%5D=231192&amp;amp;filters%5Btranslation_id%5D=21600838&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp/dev/nl/default?filters%5Bstatus%5D=either&amp;amp;filters%5Boriginal_id%5D=231191&amp;amp;filters%5Btranslation_id%5D=21600837"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp/dev/nl/default?filters%5Bstatus%5D=either&amp;amp;filters%5Boriginal_id%5D=231191&amp;amp;filters%5Btranslation_id%5D=21600837&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I couldn't reproduce this in a clean install with the current language pack. Are you using a plugin which defines &lt;code&gt;$wp_cockneyreplace&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/4.7.3/src/wp-includes/formatting.php?marks=114-127#L113"&gt;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/4.7.3/src/wp-includes/formatting.php?marks=114-127#L113&lt;/a&gt;)?

        <dc:creator>rianrietveld</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Tue, 21 Mar 2017 09:48:09 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12423#comment:83</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12423#comment:83/1490089689314593</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
During the contributors day at WordCamp London we discussed and tested the mirror code editor and discussed the use of any other code editor or syntax highlighter with @afercia @grahamarmfield @samikeijonen @rianrietveld and Adrian Roselli&lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://adrianroselli.com/bio"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://adrianroselli.com/bio&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For the test results, see previous comment by @afrecia
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Result of the discussion&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We are changing a key interface on the platform, users have expectations about how things work and are now confronted with a complete different design. This not only affects users with assistive technology, but all users of the Text interface.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The new interface is useful but should not be implemented by default, we have to inform users of the new interface with an opt-in to use it. So the new interface should not be switched on by default but selected in the settings, for example now with distraction-free mode.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It would be useful to measure how many users use which interface (WYSIWYG / Text / Code editor). Is there data from WordPress.com how many user use the text editor?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An accessible code editor wil take a long time to develop, it will be a huge undertaking. If a code editor will be added to core, users must have an accessible option (like the current Text editor) by default.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;So overall&lt;/strong&gt;
A code editor is useful, no doubt about it, but it should be implemented as an opt-in and not as default until there is an accessible version available.
&lt;/p&gt;

Plural of Dutch words often ends with 's.
If 's is followed by a space: 's  becomes automatically 'tain't.
e.g. &lt;strong&gt;programma's inclusief&lt;/strong&gt; becomes &lt;strong&gt;programma'tain'tinclusief&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I think that's the biggest problem here. "OK" is something which a user might click too fast because &lt;em&gt;everything is OK&lt;/em&gt;. See also &lt;a class="new ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40128" title="#40128: enhancement: Improve language used on media deleting confirmation (new)"&gt;#40128&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/34816" title="#34816: defect (bug): Theme Delete Button: (Prevent this page from creating additional dialogs) (closed: maybelater)"&gt;#34816&lt;/a&gt;. We should really have our own modals to get more options in making such tasks super clear.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
How about using "Delete" instead of "OK", that will make think twice before pressing "Ok" without reading the warning message:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;'Cancel' to stop, 'Delete' to delete.
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I'm not quite sure where is this modal coming from, I guess is the default modal and cannot be changed directly? Would we need a custom modal here? I can work on something but I'll appreciate some pointers on where to look or what needs to be changed.
&lt;/p&gt;

Related to the above discussion, &lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/39441/39441.7.diff" title="Attachment '39441.7.diff' in Ticket #39441"&gt;39441.7.diff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/39441/39441.7.diff" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt; is a minor update that removes the far-from-optimal way of printing the field title twice and instead produces clean markup.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With this patch, the CSS styles will be visually messed up a bit, but it shouldn't matter now since we are going for a one-column layout anyway. The markup in the patch is probably closer to what we are going to end up with though.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
During the contributors day at WordCamp London we discussed how to proceed with the Settings API changes together with
@afercia @karmatosed @flixos90 @samikeijonen @rianrietveld @hedgefield.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Result discussion&lt;/strong&gt;
We are going for the one column approach, so the labels will be above the input fields.
Advantages:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;more fresh and modern look
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;easier to design responsive
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;we can implement proper fieldsets and have better controle over the HTML to make it WCAG 2 AA accessible
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;people who only see a small part of the screen or magnify the screen still have a better understanding of the form content
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Design ideas&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;ask @michael-arestad for help, Tammie can join in if Michael has no time
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;use space/padding between the fieldsets to make them stand out
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;don't be afraid to use rules for a cleared layout
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;look at the settings page at WordPres.com with Calypso for design inspiration (but stick to WCAG rules for colours and HTML)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;maybe style fieldsets
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;maybe bigger font
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Plan of action&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;start with the settings page, in a mock up page, first get the HTML/CSS sorted out.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;start with a featured plugin on GitHub and ask for feedback and design help. @flixos90 will start with that and will get help from the design team
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;when approved and optimised we will also redesign the other pages that include tables, (e.g. all cases that use the class form-table).
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Time&lt;/strong&gt;
Get the settings page plus design plugin ready for WordCamp Europe, for review.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #40214 (Some WP instances  prematurelly try to do capability tests, before the ...) created</title>
      
        <dc:creator>dffnbfee</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Tue, 21 Mar 2017 08:22:29 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40214</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40214/1490084549263469</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
What happens is that an empty deserialized stdObject is passed (probably too early) to the WP_user object and the _wp_get_current_user function mistakenly presumes the WP_user object to be properly initialized, thus it prevents the administrators (in fact anyone from doing anything that need capability checking) from accesing the protected page.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A quick fix for the solution was this:
users.php 2487
changed from:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
if ( ! empty( $current_user )) {
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
changed to:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
if ( ! empty( $current_user ) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; isset($current_user-&amp;gt;data-&amp;gt;id)) {
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is a strange bug... it didn't effect my staging boxes running on 7.0.8 but it did effect all my boxes running 7.0.15+
It seems to me very unbeliavable that such little change can do harm, but I can reproduce it everytime I try to move the project to a box.
Sorry I'm not a WP boy but do move sites requllary and I haven't experienced such behavior with 4.6 or earlier.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While progressive JPEGs can be smaller, they are not always desired from an aesthetics standpoint.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yes! FOUT anyone? Now FOUP. Flash of Unstyled Picture...
Progressive JPGs alter the aesthetic experience of a site. And while it may be something for a site owner to consider, it should be their choice on whether to utilize or not.
Similarly, lazy loaders are not baked into Core.
The psychology of how people interact with progressive jpegs can be read here:
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://www.webperformancetoday.com/2014/09/17/progressive-image-rendering-good-evil/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://www.webperformancetoday.com/2014/09/17/progressive-image-rendering-good-evil/&lt;/a&gt;
TL;DR: the brain has to figure out what they're loooking at when they see a blurry image, then acknowledge what the object actually is when it's finally rendered. (This is very much in contrast with the Don't Make Me Think philosophy).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I could see this potentially as an option in the Media settings, but then you're dealing with regenerating all the jpegs (and doing the same when/if switching back).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is something a site owner should be responsible for IF they want to pursue it. And when the average Progressive JPG only saves a few percentage points, there are other areas to focus on. Lossless compression saves way more (25-60% in cases) than Progressive JPGs, without the aesthetic issues.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Progressive JPEGs have been around forever, but we have better technology that allows for a much superior user experience. You can't trade usability/experience for a small performance improvement, when there are better options now.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As a photographer, and as a internet user, I'm inclined to agree with Nacin, and not support this.
&lt;/p&gt;

@jnylen0 Updated patch with CSV unit tests for both category and tags added above.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
From my testing the user endpoint does not appear to accept an array or csv of slugs. I have opened &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40213" title="#40213: enhancement: REST API: Users endpoint slug parameter should allow an array of slugs (closed: fixed)"&gt;#40213&lt;/a&gt; to address this.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
The users endpoint should allow an array or csv to be passed into the slug parameter, matching user slugs with any value in the array. At current it is limited to deal with strings as discovered while working on &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40027" title="#40027: enhancement: Tags and Categories should have a &amp;#34;slugs&amp;#34; parameter for batch fetching (closed: fixed)"&gt;#40027&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This change would provide consistency with the other endpoints.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
@westonruter, my preference would be to capitalize Customizer; it's a proper noun.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don't feel strongly about this. My understanding is that “customizer” is not supposed to be capitalized, as I think the desire was for it to not become a proper noun but a generic tool. There have been discussions in Slack about this, for example: &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RQBWTW/p1470890054003385"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RQBWTW/p1470890054003385&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That being said, there are at least 4 strings that use “Customizer”. I don't feel strongly either way.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Other thoughts:
I'd love for these -- in the absence of just being able to see all my widget areas at all times, which would be my preference based on my work with users -- to have added context. So in no-sidebars, that would mean also saying "The page you're currently viewing has no widget areas," and on the other two, it would mean including the instruction on navigating while in the Customizer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I see, so you'd like to have the “other widget areas aren't shown” message to include &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Your theme has 2 other widget areas, but this particular page doesn’t display them. You can navigate to other pages on your site while using the Customizer to view and edit the widgets displayed on those pages.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
(My experience is that this is pretty (or: very) confusing for folks, and that it's not terribly intuitive (1) that you can continue to click around your site with the Customizer open and (2) that the Customizer wouldn't just be showing you all your widgets.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My experience is that it is also confusing for there to be controls shown in the panel for which there is no way to preview. This has been why contextual controls, sections, and panels have been added via &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27993" title="#27993: enhancement: Support for contexts in the Customizer (closed: fixed)"&gt;#27993&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/29758" title="#29758: enhancement: Contextual Customizer Panels and Sections (closed: fixed)"&gt;#29758&lt;/a&gt;. The customizer is synonymously known as the “live preview” interface. If you make a change to a control and you can't see it in the preview, that is also disorienting, and &lt;a class="new ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39389" title="#39389: enhancement: Customize: Make sure selective refreshed partial placement is scrolled ... (new)"&gt;#39389&lt;/a&gt; is about improving the discoverability of this by scrolling the updated are of the preview into view.
&lt;/p&gt;

Hi @dickensayieko,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This functionality is already supported, although not documented on the installation screen - it even supports MySQL Sockets/pipes using the standard syntax.
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Editing_wp-config.php#MySQL_Alternate_Port"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://codex.wordpress.org/Editing_wp-config.php#MySQL_Alternate_Port&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Given it's not common to need to change the port (or even hostname) i'm not sure adding a mention of it specifically is needed here - especially as what I'd expect to work (&lt;code&gt;hostname:port&lt;/code&gt;) will just work.
&lt;/p&gt;

Hello Core Team,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is just a suggestion.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What if your database is located on a different port, and need to adjust your connection  to connect to it during the WordPress installation process? I know that currently this can be achieved by this code:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;define( 'DB_HOST', 'localhost:3306' );
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
My suggestion is that can we add an option during the installation process to accommodate this? At the stage shown on the attached screenshot.
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://3.1m.yt/_UN_W-7.png"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://3.1m.yt/_UN_W-7.png&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thanks

@westonruter, my preference would be to capitalize Customizer; it's a proper noun. Other thoughts:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'd love for these -- in the absence of just being able to see all my widget areas at all times, which would be my preference based on my work with users -- to have added context. So in no-sidebars, that would mean also saying "The page you're currently viewing has no widget areas," and on the other two, it would mean including the instruction on navigating while in the Customizer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
(My experience is that this is pretty (or: very) confusing for folks, and that it's not terribly intuitive (1) that you can continue to click around your site with the Customizer open and (2) that the Customizer wouldn't just be showing you all your widgets.)
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
@joemcgill could you elaborate?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let's talk about the use case for a custom logo. Let's say the logo requires a 400x400 image, but we upload a 640x480 image. The user performs the crop and then… you're saying that there could very well be multiple 400x400 crops of an image that capture different parts of the image (e.g. center,center vs top,left) and so each should be able to co-exist?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What if the cropped image created a new ad hoc image size on the fly and gave it a name like, &lt;code&gt;custom_logo-400x400&lt;/code&gt; and then stored it among the &lt;code&gt;_wp_attachment_metadata&lt;/code&gt; for the main attachment. The then problem is that the different responsive image sizes for this 400x400 image would not be created, unless we were to loop through all of the theme's image sizes that are smaller than 400x400 and create a similar ad hoc image size for each, e.g. &lt;code&gt;custom_logo-{$image_size}&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This also then crosses into similar territory with &lt;a class="new ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/36441" title="#36441: defect (bug): Customizer: when setting header image, site icon and logo, do not ... (new)"&gt;#36441&lt;/a&gt;, and what happens if the user uploads a square 512x512 image when a 400x400 image is required. They shouldn't have to crop it since it's already square. But then could we create an ad hoc &lt;code&gt;custom_logo-400x400&lt;/code&gt; image size?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All of this is closely related to responsive image support for images in the customizer media control (&lt;a class="assigned ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/36191" title="#36191: defect (bug): Support responsive images in WP_Customize_Media_Control (assigned)"&gt;#36191&lt;/a&gt;).

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I still believe hiding options from users is a really, really bad decision. Displaying the message "There is 1 other widget area registered for this theme but they are not shown on the current page" is pretty much useless if the user doesn't know where the widget area is, and if it's a new theme, this is most likely going to be the case.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I can't stress enough, you're making things harder for the end user by hiding options and making them search for them, or possibly, navigate to multiple pages just to find where the widget is so that they can edit it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In Microsoft Office 2000, MS implemented a new feature called "Adaptive Menus". The idea was that the top-level menus would only show a subset of commonly used commands and the rest were hidden. MS got absolutely hammered for this decision, by usability experts and end users, which is why they dropped it a couple of years later.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To quote a leading usability expert, "Interfaces that temporarily hide the UI elements to emphasize content often increase the interaction cost, cognitive load, and the number of attention switches." - Nielsen Norman Group (&lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/zen-mode/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/zen-mode/&lt;/a&gt;)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As I mentioned in a previous comment above, instead of hiding the sidebar and showing a notification when the preview isn't showing that particular sidebar, why not show ALL the sidebars ALL the time, and simply show a notification advising people that the current sidebar wont be displayed on the currently previewed page. This way you give people the choice. If they want to see a preview of the widgets, they can navigate to another page, and if they don't care about the preview or if they don't know where the sidebar is, at least they can still update the sidebar with something.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
@westonruter On a side note, your &lt;code&gt;not-rendered-widget-area-notification.mov&lt;/code&gt; video above doesn't work. I tried downloading the file and it wont play in either VLC or Quicktime.

Took a look at the patch.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This makes sense, but it'd be good to have someone familiar with ID3 like @wonderboymusic to take a look and make sure there isn't anything that &lt;code&gt;wp_kses_post()&lt;/code&gt; sanitizes that commonly occurs in ID3 comments and would need to be preserved.

Tested, and this is working for me in all contexts besides the customizer (editing images from posts/media modal/etc).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You can do things like choose a ratio (on the right) when resizing, then shift-click to drag and maintain that ratio as well.
&lt;/p&gt;

@michelleweber has also been encountering this issue recently while helping new users, and pinged me to chat about it. She suggested some copy changes to your patch, @westonruter:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Your theme has 2 other widget areas, but this particular page doesn’t display them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You can navigate to other pages on your site while using the Customizer to view and edit the widgets displayed on those pages.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With these copy changes in place, I'd love to see this in 4.7.4.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'd like to also reconsider contextually showing things as a whole, but we can look at that in another iteration.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I'd strongly recommend everyone taking part in this discussion to spend a few minutes of their time and watch the following videos (or, better, actually test with assistive technologies) to get an idea on how non-standard solutions fail with software that expect correct HTML, proper semantics, and predictable interaction models.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Admittedly, these are just partial tests with just one screen reader and a speech recognition tool. However, they both result in a strongly increased difficulty when using the editor or even in the complete inability to enter text.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Tests run on the Theme editor with the patch from this ticket applied and on this codepen: &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://codepen.io/afercia/full/pRBxwd/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://codepen.io/afercia/full/pRBxwd/&lt;/a&gt; where the only difference is that it uses an ARIA &lt;code&gt;role: "textbox"&lt;/code&gt;, an &lt;code&gt;"aria-multiline": "true"&lt;/code&gt;, and an &lt;code&gt;aria-label&lt;/code&gt; attributes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Tests recorded by Graham Armfield at WordCamp London 2017
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Theme editor with CodeMirror, compared to the Post editor simple textarea: the most basic operations fail, while they perfectly work on the standard textarea.
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://youtu.be/AfWyqMCXI9I"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://youtu.be/AfWyqMCXI9I&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Codepen: basically the same results, also highlighting how the focus indicator (caret) and the actual insertion point are often disjointed
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://youtu.be/b03tGluQiCo"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://youtu.be/b03tGluQiCo&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Testing Safari 10 + VoiceOver on the Codepen&lt;/strong&gt;
Apart from sometimes losing the insertion point, it's pretty evident that, when navigating by word or by character, VoiceOver gets stuck when it encounters a line number:
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSW2CZkOaSI"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSW2CZkOaSI&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When removing the line numbers, things work a bit better:
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz6X1JMBlBk"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz6X1JMBlBk&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Will try to follow up with some more generic considerations soon.
&lt;/p&gt;

In many image editing apps, holding shift while you click/drag a selection "locks" the selection to a square aspect ratio. I keep trying to do this while cropping images in the Customizer (for example, logos), but holding shift doesn't do anything. Any way we could add this enhancement to cropping in the media modal?

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
After new installation 4.7.3 on the homepage is only a list of latest post (i.e. "Hello Word!") with some widgets. There are no menus.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
See example: &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_zVkWFJBp8bQ2Nub3RIaGRFaEk/view?usp=sharing"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_zVkWFJBp8bQ2Nub3RIaGRFaEk/view?usp=sharing&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When I click on the Customize (and nothing else), I see menu and static page with some sections:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
See example: &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_zVkWFJBp8bRDJHVWFXU2JKYWs/view?usp=sharing"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_zVkWFJBp8bRDJHVWFXU2JKYWs/view?usp=sharing&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When I click on Save&amp;amp;Publish, the new configuration is saved - although I didn't change any option!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When user clicks on Customize, he should get the same content like it is on the front side - it should be changed only after he changes an option in customizer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This problem appears only at the beginning, after installation - when I change any option, it is saved, shown on the front side and in the customizer, too. But, the problem in the first step is important for new users.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The similar problem I had in 4.7.2.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Mon, 20 Mar 2017 18:44:50 GMT</pubDate>

      <description>duplicate: &lt;p&gt;
@goth69 Thanks for the screenshots.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ok, the fundamental issue here is that metaboxes do not work in the customizer at all. Metaboxes are a PHP-centric approach to adding custom fields to screens in the admin. The customizer, on the other hand, is a single page application that requires a JavaScript-centric approach for extending nav menu items with custom fields. See &lt;a class="new ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/18584" title="#18584: enhancement: Nav menus need more hooks for extensibility (on admin page &amp;amp; in customizer) (new)"&gt;#18584&lt;/a&gt;. This has to be addressed before looking at adding support for toggling which nav menu item custom fields are displayed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To add new checkboxes here it will really require much more than adding another selector on the line indicated. It will also require a change in selectors in &lt;code&gt;wp.customize.Menus.MenusPanel.ready&lt;/code&gt;, but even more so it will creating a function like &lt;code&gt;wp.customize.Menus.MenusPanel.saveManageColumnsState&lt;/code&gt; which specifically is responsible for making the &lt;code&gt;closed-postboxes&lt;/code&gt;  admin-ajax requests, where the former only does &lt;code&gt;hidden-columns&lt;/code&gt; admin ajax requests for the nav menus screen.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In any case, this is really a duplicate of &lt;a class="new ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/18584" title="#18584: enhancement: Nav menus need more hooks for extensibility (on admin page &amp;amp; in customizer) (new)"&gt;#18584&lt;/a&gt;.

@nickkeenan I cannot reproduce this issue.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The call to &lt;code&gt;send_frame_options_header()&lt;/code&gt; happens &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;WP::send_headers()&lt;/code&gt; which is what invokes &lt;code&gt;WP_Customize_Manager::filter_iframe_security_headers()&lt;/code&gt; via the &lt;code&gt;wp_headers&lt;/code&gt; filter. Because &lt;code&gt;WP::send_headers()&lt;/code&gt; uses &lt;code&gt;header( $header )&lt;/code&gt; and leaves off the second &lt;code&gt;$replace&lt;/code&gt; parameter, the default value of &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; will be used. This means the last-sent &lt;code&gt;X-Frame-Options&lt;/code&gt; header sent should be the one that ultimately gets sent to the client.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I set up a similar configuration as you, with WordPress installed in a subdirectory, the &lt;code&gt;home&lt;/code&gt; being set to &lt;code&gt;http://core-subdirectory.vvv&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;siteurl&lt;/code&gt; being set to &lt;code&gt;http://core-subdirectory.vvv/src&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When I go to &lt;code&gt;http://core-subdirectory.vvv/src/wp-admin/customize.php&lt;/code&gt;, I get this response header back:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
When I look at the network console for the document loaded into the iframe, here &lt;code&gt;http://core-subdirectory.vvv/?customize_changeset_uuid=92126aad-72f7-4c15-a7b1-e73ed23fb7a4&amp;amp;customize_theme=twentyseventeen&amp;amp;customize_messenger_channel=preview-0&lt;/code&gt;, I get these headers in the response:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;X-Frame-Options: ALLOW-FROM http://core-subdirectory.vvv/src/wp-admin/customize.php
Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors http://core-subdirectory.vvv
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So I'm not sure why your &lt;code&gt;X-Frame-Options&lt;/code&gt; headers are showing multiple combined values that conflict. My best guess is that your web server is configured to add this additional value to the &lt;code&gt;X-Frame-Options&lt;/code&gt; response header, or you have a plugin that is calling something like:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;add_action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'send_headers'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;header&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

@chris10ssmith what are the details on the domain mapping you have? Note there is a known issue with the customizer and the &lt;code&gt;siteurl&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;home&lt;/code&gt; options not matching. See &lt;a class="assigned ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39128" title="#39128: defect (bug): Customize: Preview fails to load when domain mapping in use ... (assigned)"&gt;#39128&lt;/a&gt;. There is a &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://gist.github.com/westonruter/a9c6841ba7f28192e3eb7d90c9316e75"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;workaround plugin&lt;/a&gt; referenced on that ticket that seems to alleviate the symptoms for the underlying issue on that ticket, and it may help alleviate your symptoms as well. Nevertheless, it sounds like your underlying issue is different.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You said this is a multisite install. Is the issue happening on the primary site or on one of the subdomain sites?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Can you look at the network console to see which URLs are being repeatedly redirected to?
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I had seen the &lt;code&gt;@private&lt;/code&gt; in core somewhere, so for some reason I thought it was the way to go (e.g. &lt;code&gt;__clear_multi_author_cache()&lt;/code&gt;, though that's obviously really old). I agree that doesn't really make sense.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Regarding the change, I think it is good to go into a minor release (now with the new cycle at least). It's not a regression, but a minor bugfix (regarding the missing &lt;code&gt;home&lt;/code&gt;) and improvement (less aggressive cache invalidation) where I don't see problems arising from. I'd personally lean towards backporting it for 4.7.4.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
@stephdau We can likely handle the parameters in the same way as a function like &lt;code&gt;add_query_arg()&lt;/code&gt; works: You can either pass a key and a value as two separate parameters, or an array of key =&amp;gt; value pairs (in that case the second parameter would be ignored). This makes the function flexible enough for these use-cases.
&lt;/p&gt;

I get this when you view in the text editor, so copied the Google URL and pasted in visual tab of the editor, over the &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://example.com"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://example.com&lt;/a&gt; original URL.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;[foo bar="&amp;lt;a href="https://www.google.com/"&amp;gt;http://example.com&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;"]

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Hi there,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
i have got a simple example according to the WooCommerce Endpoints meta box.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;function add_nav_menu_meta_boxes() {
        add_meta_box( 'test-metabox', 'Test MetaBox Title', 'test_metabox_callback', 'nav-menus', 'side', 'low' );
}
add_action( 'admin_init', 'add_nav_menu_meta_boxes' );
function test_metabox_callback() {
        echo '&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Test Content&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;';
}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;I think the behavior of the sample meta box is not the appropriate behavior, because the meta box does not appear in Customizer, only the meta box toggle. I will add some screenshots, too.
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt; My workaround for the problem is using a '.metabox-prefs' selector instead of '.metabox-prefs:first' selector.
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Setting it to 100% will cause all buttons to disappear if div with class &lt;code&gt;media-toolbar-secondary&lt;/code&gt; is filled in with anything on all screens.

more info on research:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;bug appears on "non-standard" new WP instances domains, eg. "mydemodomain.press";
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've created new WP instance on "standard" domain, "mydemodomain.com" - bug doesn't exist;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
it's deeply related to Plupload and/or Chrome's recent security changes

&lt;p&gt;
It sounds like this is probably already happening during any normal post update, no?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Upon a closer look, we &lt;a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/4.7.3/src/wp-includes/rest-api/endpoints/class-wp-rest-posts-controller.php?marks=669,676,710-712#L669"&gt;never pass&lt;/a&gt; &lt;code&gt;page_template&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;wp_update_post&lt;/code&gt;, so &lt;a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/4.7.3/src/wp-includes/post.php#L3406"&gt;its logic&lt;/a&gt; for updating a page template is never triggered by the API.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So this looks like a pretty straightforward change to me, only touching &lt;code&gt;WP_REST_Posts_Controller::handle_template&lt;/code&gt;.  @swissspidy do you agree or is there something I'm missing here?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ideally, we fix &lt;code&gt;wp_update_post()&lt;/code&gt;, remove the call to &lt;code&gt;handle_template()&lt;/code&gt; and add a new test for this behaviour.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Couldn't we just unset &lt;code&gt;$data['template']&lt;/code&gt; from the update if it's the same as the current value?  This would skip both passing it to &lt;code&gt;wp_update_post&lt;/code&gt; and calling &lt;code&gt;handle_template&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
the meta entry would get updated &lt;em&gt;twice&lt;/em&gt;  because the &lt;code&gt;update_item()&lt;/code&gt; method calls &lt;code&gt;WP_REST_Posts_Controller::handle_template()&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This may be a question for another day but in &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/issues/2065"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/issues/2065&lt;/a&gt; there is discussion around posts and users also having slug filters. Should these also be amended to receive arrays?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The posts endpoint already supports filtering by multiple slugs, see &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38579" title="#38579: enhancement: REST API: Allow listing posts that match any of a set of slugs rather ... (closed: fixed)"&gt;#38579&lt;/a&gt;.  If the users endpoint doesn't, then yes, we should add that too.  Want to create a separate ticket for that?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I would like to see one of the new &lt;code&gt;test_get_items_slug_array_arg&lt;/code&gt; tests changed to &lt;code&gt;test_get_items_slug_csv_arg&lt;/code&gt; with the slugs passed as a comma-separated string like &lt;code&gt;taco,burrito,enchilada&lt;/code&gt;.  Otherwise &lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/40027/40027.3.diff" title="Attachment '40027.3.diff' in Ticket #40027"&gt;40027.3.diff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/40027/40027.3.diff" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt; looks good to me and I will test and commit it later this week.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I’ve done some research:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Windows 10, Chrome 57.0.2987.110 (64-bit);
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;in my opinion it’s not related to server’s setup: on other browsers – it works;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol start="3"&gt;&lt;li&gt;previous instances of WP 4.7.3 – Select Files works;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;new instances of WP 4.7.3 – Select Files no reaction;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol start="5"&gt;&lt;li&gt;it’s partialy Plupload/Moxie issue (&lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://www.plupload.com/punbb/viewtopic.php?id=14914"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://www.plupload.com/punbb/viewtopic.php?id=14914&lt;/a&gt;) – it’s used on that Select Files button by WP core, to generate hidden file input with accept argument which holds accepted mime/file types;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol start="6"&gt;&lt;li&gt;workaround # 1:
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;
6.1. open (using chrome, win10) wp-admin &amp;gt; media &amp;gt; library &amp;gt; click “add new” (while in grid, not list) – “Drop files anywhere to upload” block appears with Select Files button;
6.2. open chrome developer console, find that hidden file input, it’s right before &amp;lt;/body&amp;gt; tag, named with eg. id=”html5_1bblpaq4r1ee0e6ich21tge1mus5″ and it has big accept argument with file types;
6.3. copy “accept” attribute big value to your favourite text editor, find “application/zip”, change it to “application/x-zip”, then copy-replace new big list of mimes/file-types to that “accept” attribute (don’t refersh page);
6.4. click on Select Files – it should work;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start="7"&gt;&lt;li&gt;workaround # 2:
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;
7.1. open chrome settings, show advanced settings at the bottom, under Privacy uncheck “Protect you and your device from dangerous websites”;
7.2. refresh media library page and go to Select Files (like in 6.1. explanation) – the button should work.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start="8"&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve tried application/x-zip-compressed – bug not resolved – button didn’t work.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think it’s more chrome bug, related to recently strenghtened malware/virus protection.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;wp core team should make an exception for this situation to use application/x-zip instead of application/zip with Plupload/Moxie. or just to work with chrome team to sort out this.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</description>

      <title>Ticket #40206 (wp_insert_term() $slug_provided check fails) created</title>
      
        <dc:creator>esemlabel</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Mon, 20 Mar 2017 11:56:26 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40206</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40206/1490010986137101</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Imagine 2 city terms with same name, whereas state is stored inside its term_meta.
"Washington, Connecticut"
"Washington, Georgia"
So you have 2 identical names, but technically different terms with appropriate content.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If one of this city is already saved with slug "washington-2", than you will not able to save the second without manually set slug value to "washington".
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The problem is in wp_insert_term() func.
&lt;a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/src/wp-includes/taxonomy.php#L2018"&gt;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/src/wp-includes/taxonomy.php#L2018&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$name_match&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$slug_match&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;get_term_by&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'slug'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$slug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$taxonomy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$slug_provided&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$name_match&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;slug&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$slug&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$slug_match&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// return new WP_Error
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
As result, $name_match-&amp;gt;slug !== $slug &amp;amp;&amp;amp; ! $slug_match, but $slug_provided weren't provided, so it return WP_Error, instead of save new term "Washington" with slug "washington".
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think the last 2 of 3 checks is enough and &lt;strong&gt;! $slug_provided&lt;/strong&gt; shouldn't exits here.
&lt;/p&gt;

I agree with @ocean90 that the underscore and &lt;code&gt;@private&lt;/code&gt; should be removed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don't think &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/15605" title="#15605: defect (bug): Bulk spam/unspam of a blog leads to inconsistencies when object cache ... (closed: fixed)"&gt;#15605&lt;/a&gt; is a concern. Overall, this change results in fewer iterations through the cache process when unrelated options are changed, and more accurate cache invalidation when &lt;code&gt;home&lt;/code&gt; is changed.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
To me that looks like a big change which you want to ship in a minor version. I think it needs some more soak time to get it tested on w.org and maybe even wp.com (@stephdau) . Did you check that &lt;a class="changeset" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/40305" title="Multisite: Handle sites cache invalidation more granularly for option ..."&gt;[40305]&lt;/a&gt; doesn't revert &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/15605" title="#15605: defect (bug): Bulk spam/unspam of a blog leads to inconsistencies when object cache ... (closed: fixed)"&gt;#15605&lt;/a&gt;?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What's the reason behind making the new function "private"? &lt;code&gt;@private&lt;/code&gt; doesn't seem to be an official PHPDoc tag and all the other clean_* functions are without an underscore as well.
&lt;/p&gt;

@MatheusGimenez - yep, sorry, my mistake.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I am adding patch now using your functional changes, and adding slug array unit tests to the category and tag controller tests.
This may be a question for another day but in &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/issues/2065"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/issues/2065&lt;/a&gt; there is discussion around posts and users also having slug filters. Should these also be amended to receive arrays?
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
@jnylen0 This can occur when a post and related post_meta are deleted with a MySQL query, instead of using &lt;code&gt;wp_delete_post()&lt;/code&gt;.  An attachment can have only one &lt;code&gt;post_parent&lt;/code&gt; in WordPress but be used in multiple posts (talk about functionality that is kinda broken).  Is this situation common?  NO.  Should our REST API endpoints return invalid data due to PHP Errors when it does?  I wouldn't consider attachment pages as an apple to apple comparison for our media endpoint.
&lt;/p&gt;

Thanks for the patch. Can't believe we miss this. The only thing I would change is that I would also add lang_id&lt;span class="underline"&gt;in and lang_id&lt;/span&gt;not_in to bring it inline with other params

I believe Snoopy is an abandoned project (hasn't been updated since 2014). Is this maintained in WordPress as a fork? I can update the patch if so.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A quick look at &lt;a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/trunk/src/wp-includes/class-snoopy.php?action=stop_on_copy&amp;amp;mode=follow_copy&amp;amp;rev=40305&amp;amp;stop_rev=&amp;amp;limit=100&amp;amp;sfp_email=&amp;amp;sfph_mail="&gt;the history&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;code&gt;wp-includes/class-snoopy.php&lt;/code&gt; shows it's been continuing to receive compatibility updates where and when required these past few years since being deprecated ~7 years ago &lt;a class="changeset" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/14052" title="Mark Snoopy as deprecated. see #12882"&gt;r14052&lt;/a&gt;
