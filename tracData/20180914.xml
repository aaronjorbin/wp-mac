      <description>&lt;i&gt;Keywords&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Type&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Hi! Thanks for the report, and apologies for the delay in a reply.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The default action for uploads in posts and the media library doesn't include cropping, so I suspect you're probably running into a problem with one of the Customizer or Appearance upload/cropping flows.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Could you please walk me through the steps you're taking, and which case you're running into where it always asks for a crop?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thanks much!
&lt;/p&gt;

Hey @calin!
Sorry for the wait on further comments, and thanks again for the patches.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yes, I've got a couple of questions:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Would it be possible to handle the writing part of this within &lt;code&gt;make_image()&lt;/code&gt;, since this is much of the use-case for it? It's fine to extend &lt;code&gt;make_image()&lt;/code&gt; for Imagick like GD does if that is necessary. If that's not preferred, any reasoning would be great.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Could you please walk me through the reasoning for &lt;code&gt;$imagick_filename&lt;/code&gt; and its use?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Thanks much!
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #40795 (If plugin zip file has very long name, windows systems can fail to upgrade) updated</title>
      
        <dc:creator>rogerlos</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Fri, 14 Sep 2018 22:01:22 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40795#comment:4</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40795#comment:4/1536962482203107</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Clarifying: One of the reasons SearchWP failed to upgrade was not only was the &lt;code&gt;zip&lt;/code&gt; filename large, the plugin uses a deeply nested directory structure as well. So a reasonable-length filename can still keep windows from creating a new directory if the total character length of the path is over 247 characters:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;C:/wamp/www/example/wp-content/upgrade/REASONABLE_LENGTH_ZIP_FILE_NAME-d8310f/
20-character-dirname/20-character-dirname/20-character-dirname/
20-character-dirname/20-character-dirname/20-character-dirname/
20-character-dirname/20-character-dirname/new
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Would also fail.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In this case, WordPress would have no knowledge at the time of the &lt;code&gt;wp_tempnam()&lt;/code&gt; call that the code using the returned result would be adding hundreds of additional characters to the path.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Welp.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Perhaps there is nothing which could really be done other than make it clear to authors that deeply-nested directory structures combined with long filenames means they're flirting with failure.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I do not know enough about windows (or &lt;code&gt;mkdir&lt;/code&gt;) to know if this limit is always true, or only if using absolute paths. If the latter, it might be able to be skirting by calling &lt;code&gt;mkdir&lt;/code&gt; using a relative path repeatedly, but I have no idea.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;In sum:&lt;/strong&gt; This is an actual problem, but I have no idea what an actual solution might be. My max-length solution would probably catch all but the edge-cases of edge-cases, and would have caught the actual error in this particular instance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At the very least, documentation? And perhaps something in the repository review process which flags deeply-nested file structures and lets the developer know they're treading on dangerous ground?
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I'm not entirely clear on your question, but:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;wp_tempnam()&lt;/code&gt; is in &lt;code&gt;wp-admin/includes/file.php&lt;/code&gt; at (currently) line 622
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The long filename which caused the upgrade to fail was created as part of the automatic WP upgrade process, I assume based on the zip provided to the plugins repository
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I am not an expert on this bit of WordPress, but as far as I can determine, &lt;code&gt;wp_tempnam()&lt;/code&gt; is used to avoid naming conflicts in processes which might touch a number of files, or write to a common directory. It does this by adding a hyphen + six random characters to the filename. (Sorry for restating stuff you probably already know!)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, in theory, it should not matter what WP returns from this function, as the "tempnam" is just that, a temporary name to use for the duration of a single process, or be passed as a parameter to other processes. WordPress itself seems to think six characters of noise is enough to avoid conflicts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I would suggest that code which attempts to parse a returned value from &lt;code&gt;wp_tempnam()&lt;/code&gt; is not adhering to best practices. The code should already know what was passed to that function, or if it's "downstream" code, the original name should have been passed as a parameter.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As far as I can tell, the only things which might break if a length limit was enforced are such situations. But I can't say that with any authority.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Rather than enforcing a set limit, perhaps &lt;code&gt;wp_tempnam()&lt;/code&gt; can add a "this is really huge" test and only truncate those filenames that fail it. That test would have to be something like this pseudocode:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;$fail = strlen( $path_on_disk ) + strlen( $filename ) &amp;gt;= $max_path[ $server_os ];
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But that seems like a lot more work than just deciding on an upper limit, as you now have to detect operating systems, find out what their limits are, etc.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Another option would be to simply return &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; (or throw an exception) if the result of the calculation is longer than whatever the arbitrary limit is.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
(An alternative would be to establish an arbitrary but healthy filename length limit as a max for developers adding files to the WP repository. 64 seems like plenty to me, but even 128 would have allowed SearchWP to update.)
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Appreciate the thoughtful breakdown of the problem, and the suggested solution!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Just a quick practical question. Is the change you're suggesting for this based on the WordPress download itself? I checked through and didn't find the location listed above for &lt;code&gt;wp_tempnam()&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If this change is implemented what would be some helpful things to validate to ensure it isn't breaking anything else?
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Howdy! Thanks so much for sharing. Really great thoughts and glad you're looking at ways to improve the usability of finding plugins. Welcome :)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Adding options to filter search results could be useful. We just want to make sure that any features we're adding improve the user experience and don't complicate things. My concern right now is that most of the filtering options you suggested, while quite useful to folks who know WordPress, could make the interface feel complicated to folks who just want to find a good plugin.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I did a quick search for Contact Form and found 296 pages. That's pretty overwhelming. The question though is, am I more likely to start filtering results if they're available, or would I just pick the first couple results and open their pages?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This would be a perfect candidate for some simple user testing!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With that said, if we included filtering it might make sense to hide it as an advanced search option. See my suggested sketch below.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Look forward to continued discussion on this!
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Taking a look at this, and noticed that there is an existing extended description further up in the docs that was added in &lt;a class="changeset" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/27472" title="Allow $crop in add_image_size() to receive crop anchors (top, left, ..."&gt;[27472]&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Is this sufficient? Should we move some of that documentation down, or add to it?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Doesn't sound like an issue to me.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So you're saying that, once you've committed &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38218" title="#38218: enhancement: Make post type labels work during locale switching (closed: duplicate)"&gt;#38218&lt;/a&gt;, we should be fine calling &lt;code&gt;switch_to_locale()&lt;/code&gt; during &lt;code&gt;WP_REST_Server::serve_request()&lt;/code&gt; which happens during the &lt;code&gt;parse_request&lt;/code&gt; action, right? Is the reason for that because, besides CPT strings, there are very few strings translated before that?

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I have installed WordPress 4.9.8 locally under Mamp. Last year, the local installation went smoothly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Classic Editor, normal editor: I can create, save and publish all posts, pages.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Gutenberg Editor: No page or post can be saved or published. No preview and no caching is possible, although the creation works with blocks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I tried it with Chrome, Firefox and Edge. Have also activated the themes of WordPress to see if it is the theme. Always the same, normal editor saves, Gutenberg not.
At Addons I only have 5, Classic Editor, Gutenberg, UpdraftPlus (disabled), All in One Seo Pack, Autoptimize. I deactivated them one after the other, but always the same result.
&lt;/p&gt;

I've also seen this "HTTP error" message when uploading MP3s and MP4s. I wonder if there's a way to pass through the message from whatever error is being triggered in the media uploader and expose it to the user in place of the generic error.

This approach makes sense to me.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think we still need tests for the change though, and developers should receive an extra heads-up about this, as this might affect folks who interact closely with post type capabilities. It could be part of a general dev-note about capability improvements.
&lt;/p&gt;

Follow up to &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24553" title="#24553: defect (bug): &amp;#34;{user} is currently editing&amp;#34; messages on post listing screen causes ... (closed: fixed)"&gt;#24553&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The CSS animation added in &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24553" title="#24553: defect (bug): &amp;#34;{user} is currently editing&amp;#34; messages on post listing screen causes ... (closed: fixed)"&gt;#24553&lt;/a&gt; doesn't work as expected for a couple reasons:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;height "auto" can't be animated with CSS
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;jQuery &lt;code&gt;delay()&lt;/code&gt; works only for the jQuery effects queue, not for other methods like &lt;code&gt;empty()&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The original intent of this animation was to make the "user is currently editing" info smoothly slide in and out, avoiding "jumps" in the UI that could be disturbing for users.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a style="padding:0; border:none" href="http://cldup.com/PQ-g8mGRYw.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://cldup.com/PQ-g8mGRYw.png" alt="http://cldup.com/PQ-g8mGRYw.png" crossorigin="anonymous" title="http://cldup.com/PQ-g8mGRYw.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'd say either the leftover code related to the animation should be removed or the animation should be fixed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

@desrosj &lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/44234/44234.diff" title="Attachment '44234.diff' in Ticket #44234"&gt;44234.diff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/44234/44234.diff" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt; looks good.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/44234/44234-2.diff" title="Attachment '44234-2.diff' in Ticket #44234"&gt;44234-2.diff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/44234/44234-2.diff" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt; contains few suggestions:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adds test cases for the filters:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;user_erasure_fulfillment_email_to&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;user_erasure_complete_email_subject&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;user_confirmed_action_email_content&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I only used the first input argument of those filter, so it's open for improvements to add the other arguments.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fixes the request type from &lt;code&gt;'earase_personal_data'&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;'remove_personal_data'&lt;/code&gt;. It's defined as the latter in the &lt;code&gt;WP_Privacy_Data_Removal_Requests_Table&lt;/code&gt; class. But in general I would have preferred the &lt;code&gt;'earase_personal_data'&lt;/code&gt; name of that action type :-)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adds &lt;code&gt;::&lt;/code&gt; for the global function in the &lt;code&gt;@covers&lt;/code&gt; annotation for &lt;code&gt;_wp_privacy_send_erasure_fulfillment_notification&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Uses "send an email" instead of "send emails" in inline method descriptions, to make it clear that it only sends a single email.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The unit tests are a useful documentation, so what about changing the order of methods; show first the methods that explain how it should work, then after that the methods for failing/error? This is applied in the patch.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adds inline comments within methods:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;test_should_send_email_only_once()&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;test_should_not_send_email_when_request_not_completed()&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;test_should_not_send_email_when_not_wp_user_request()&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adjusted the description of the &lt;code&gt;test_should_not_send_email_when_not_wp_user_request()&lt;/code&gt; method.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Changes &lt;code&gt;'erase-my-data@local.dev'&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;'erase-my-data@local.test'&lt;/code&gt; as the &lt;code&gt;.dev&lt;/code&gt; domain is no longer suitable for local.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;$mailer-&amp;gt;get_sent()-&amp;gt;to&lt;/code&gt; is:
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;[0] =&amp;gt; Array
   (
		[0] =&amp;gt; erase-my-data@local.test
		[1] =&amp;gt;
	)
)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
so it seems like &lt;code&gt;$mailer-&amp;gt;get_sent()-&amp;gt;to[0][0]&lt;/code&gt; should be used instead of &lt;code&gt;$mailer-&amp;gt;get_sent()-&amp;gt;to[0]&lt;/code&gt;.
I used &lt;code&gt;$mailer-&amp;gt;get_recipient( 'to' )-&amp;gt;address&lt;/code&gt; instead, as it is a wrapper for &lt;code&gt;$mailer-&amp;gt;get_sent()-&amp;gt;to&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Moves
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;wp_update_post(
	array(
		'ID'          =&amp;gt; self::$request_id,
		'post_status' =&amp;gt; 'request-completed',
	)
);
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
into the &lt;code&gt;wpSetUpBeforeClass()&lt;/code&gt; method to reduce code duplications, as I was also starting to use it in the new methods.
&lt;/p&gt;

This is due to PHP 7.3 deprecating this approach. Attaching a patch for this one and one more use in phpunit utils.php.

      <title>Ticket #44944 (Possibly incorrect use of "continue" in wp-includeds/pomo/plural-forms.php) created</title>
      
        <dc:creator>tobifjellner</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Fri, 14 Sep 2018 09:36:43 GMT</pubDate>

      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44944/1536917803551741</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
It seems as if wp-includeds/pomo/plural-forms.php uses a "stray" &lt;code&gt;continue&lt;/code&gt; in line 210. This causes a warning to appear on some sites:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Warning: "continue" targeting switch is equivalent to "break". Did you mean to use "continue 2"? in [REDACTED]/wp-includes/pomo/plural-forms.php on line 210
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Initial report (in Swedish): @rdcsg in &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://sv.wordpress.org/support/topic/konstigt-felmeddelande-dyker-upp-pa-sajten-sen-dagar-tillbaka/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://sv.wordpress.org/support/topic/konstigt-felmeddelande-dyker-upp-pa-sajten-sen-dagar-tillbaka/&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Just took another stab at this, using a magic getter and callbacks to make things work.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Includes some basic tests for post type labels already.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Note that you need to generate the &lt;code&gt;de_DE.mo&lt;/code&gt; file in the test directory yourself before running the tests.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Let's try to reduce the context to 5-6 words
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cast the value to an integer (&lt;code&gt;(int) _x( … )&lt;/code&gt;)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Provide a fallback if &lt;code&gt;(int) _x( … )&lt;/code&gt; returns 0

      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44943/1536904377802179</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I  would like to report a vulnerability that is categorized under "A9:2017-Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities"  and can lead to denial of service.
Please read the report , before marking as not valid because of DoS  ( Note:- there has been no attempt made to DoS the freshbooks web application )
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Vulnerability:- &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://wordpress.org/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://wordpress.org/&lt;/a&gt; uses word press as a backend engine to run its web application and using CVE-2018-6389 an anonymous user can cause Denial of service. In this vulnerability an attacker will pass all the possible javascript library and the application tries to load all the functions and send it back in response. Passing a large list of js functions can consume lot processing to responed back and if done from various location/ips/browser tabs can lead to DoS. This attack can lead to generate upto 3mb size response per request.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Url :-  &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://wordpress.org/wp-admin/load-scripts.php?load=eutil,common,wp-a11y,sack,quicktag,colorpicker,editor,wp-fullscreen-stu,wp-ajax-response,wp-api-request,wp-pointer,autosave,heartbeat,wp-auth-check,wp-lists,prototype,scriptaculous-root,scriptaculous-builder,scriptaculous-dragdrop,scriptaculous-effects,scriptaculous-slider,scriptaculous-sound,scriptaculous-controls,scriptaculous,cropper,jquery,jquery-core,jquery-migrate,jquery-ui-core,jquery-effects-core,jquery-effects-blind,jquery-effects-bounce,jquery-effects-clip,jquery-effects-drop,jquery-effects-explode,jquery-effects-fade,jquery-effects-fold,jquery-effects-highlight,jquery-effects-puff,jquery-effects-pulsate,jquery-effects-scale,jquery-effects-shake,jquery-effects-size,jquery-effects-slide,jquery-effects-transfer"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://wordpress.org/wp-admin/load-scripts.php?load=eutil,common,wp-a11y,sack,quicktag,colorpicker,editor,wp-fullscreen-stu,wp-ajax-response,wp-api-request,wp-pointer,autosave,heartbeat,wp-auth-check,wp-lists,prototype,scriptaculous-root,scriptaculous-builder,scriptaculous-dragdrop,scriptaculous-effects,scriptaculous-slider,scriptaculous-sound,scriptaculous-controls,scriptaculous,cropper,jquery,jquery-core,jquery-migrate,jquery-ui-core,jquery-effects-core,jquery-effects-blind,jquery-effects-bounce,jquery-effects-clip,jquery-effects-drop,jquery-effects-explode,jquery-effects-fade,jquery-effects-fold,jquery-effects-highlight,jquery-effects-puff,jquery-effects-pulsate,jquery-effects-scale,jquery-effects-shake,jquery-effects-size,jquery-effects-slide,jquery-effects-transfer&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Possible fixes:-
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;change default "admin" directory name (Security through obscurity)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;or apply some password protection to /wp-admin/ url
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Impact:-
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
DoS of the site and application server
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Please find the attached screenshot demonstrating the PoC.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Note: - My intention was never to hamper this platform in any manner just wanted to report in a responsible way.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I think that it can be corrected below, but is there something wrong?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;function wp_slash( $value ) {
	if ( is_array( $value ) ) {
		foreach ( $value as $k =&amp;gt; $v ) {
			if ( is_array( $v ) ) {
				$value[ $k ] = wp_slash( $v );
			} else {
				if (is_bool( $v )) {
					$v = (int) $v;
				}
				$value[ $k ] = addslashes( $v );
			}
		}
	} else {
		if ( is_bool( $value ) ) {
			$value = (int) $value;
		}
		$value = addslashes( $value );
	}
	return $value;
}

      <title>Ticket #44758 (The REST API is not respecting the user's locale properly.) updated</title>
      
        <dc:creator>swissspidy</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Fri, 14 Sep 2018 05:00:20 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44758#comment:22</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44758#comment:22/1536901220360960</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Summaryoftheissue"&gt;Summary of the issue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Calling &lt;code&gt;switch_locale()&lt;/code&gt; during &lt;code&gt;WP_REST_Server::serve_request()&lt;/code&gt; would change the site's locale much later than it normally is (an exception being when emailing users, locale switching happens very late in those cases). By that point, many strings (including CPT strings) were already translated and so will be in the wrong language.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So: I think REST API design says we'd prefer to switch the locale during &lt;code&gt;WP_REST_Server::serve_request()&lt;/code&gt;, but all the rest of WP's code expects the locale to be set much earlier and not change (with a few exceptions). So what do we do?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Doesn't sound like an issue to me. If we fix the post type label ticket first, this is the way to go IMO. That's a perfect use case for &lt;code&gt;switch_to_locale()&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As mentioned yesterday, I'll take another stab at &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38218" title="#38218: enhancement: Make post type labels work during locale switching (closed: duplicate)"&gt;#38218&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi Myriam,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sorry to hear you're experiencing issues with the visual editor. Does it still happen with all plugins disabled and a default theme (Twenty Seventeen) activated?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

      <description>maybelater: &lt;p&gt;
After some discussion here, as well as the previous discussion in &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25275" title="#25275: enhancement: Checking if attachment is audio/video (closed: fixed)"&gt;#25275&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt;, the general consensus seems to be that there isn't currently a compelling reason to add these functions at this time. The desire to create consistency across the codebase with &lt;code&gt;wp_attachment_is_image()&lt;/code&gt; is reasonable, but the burden required to maintain this consistency by adding new functions for each supported attachment type over time, along with the very likely potential of these wrapping functions diverging over time, is more persuasive at this time. However, if our thinking shifts in the future, &lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/41802/41802.diff" title="Attachment '41802.diff' in Ticket #41802"&gt;41802.diff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/41802/41802.diff" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt; is a model for how we would want to execute this.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Closing for now as &lt;code&gt;maybelater&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Any related discussion about deprecating &lt;code&gt;wp_attachment_is_image()&lt;/code&gt; should happen in a separate ticket.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Please post a link to the support thread you have opened, but not had a helpful answer in. Some may want to chime in.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the mean time I suggest trying this plugin &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/health-check/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://wordpress.org/plugins/health-check/&lt;/a&gt; to help sort out what theme or plugin that interferes with your editor. I had the same problem today and this plugin sorted it out immediately.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Hi,
I can’t get the visual editor to work any more. I only get the html code and text page.
I’m not a coder so I need a WYSIWYG editor.
Could you please help me to proceed in this issue.
I’ve spent so much time searching on how to resolve this to no avail.
I have read a lot of your documentation but it makes no sense and I can’t get my answer through the forums.
Also my hosting company won’t help me either they say to get onto WordPress.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I’m using Sydney theme.
Looking forward to your reply.
Thanks.
Regards,
Myriam
&lt;/p&gt;

After discussion in yesterday's #core-privacy chat, it was determined that the data should be exported as follows:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the user's locale matches the site's default locale, only one export file in that locale will be generated.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the user's locale does not match the site's default locale, two files will be added to the ZIP file (one in each locale).
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the administrator's locale does not match either of these, no additional action will be performed.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

The &lt;code&gt;updated&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;error&lt;/code&gt; notices are supported with the &lt;code&gt;div.updated&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;div.error&lt;/code&gt; selectors, but adding &lt;code&gt;div.warning&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;div.info&lt;/code&gt; to core would probably result in plugin and theme elements unintentionally being styled.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If the &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; selectors are preferred, that could maybe go into a major release if accompanied by a &lt;code&gt;dev-note&lt;/code&gt;, but that doesn't address all backward compatibility concerns.

The &lt;code&gt;add_settings_error()&lt;/code&gt; only supports &lt;code&gt;error&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;updated&lt;/code&gt; admin notices. These should also be supported for scenarios where error or updated are not appropriate.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I did some minor cleanup in &lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/44233/44233.6.diff" title="Attachment '44233.6.diff' in Ticket #44233"&gt;44233.6.diff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/44233/44233.6.diff" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Minor coding standards issues
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Removing comments that didn't feel necessary because the code was descriptive on its own.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prefixing the (global) function name with &lt;code&gt;::&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;@covers&lt;/code&gt; annotation, so PHPUnit's code coverage can find the function
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The one big change I made was to remove the &lt;code&gt;try...catch&lt;/code&gt; blocks (and related code) in favor of the existing  &lt;code&gt;WPDieException&lt;/code&gt; / &lt;code&gt;setExpectedException()&lt;/code&gt; pattern used elsewhere in the suite. The avoids the problem mentioned in &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44233#comment:18" title="Comment 18"&gt;comment:18&lt;/a&gt;, and makes the code smaller and easier to read. &lt;code&gt;setExpectedException()&lt;/code&gt; was deprecated in PHPUnit &lt;code&gt;7&lt;/code&gt;, but Core already has a shim for it that calls &lt;code&gt;expectException()&lt;/code&gt;. This should be back-compat with PHPUnit &lt;code&gt;3.7&lt;/code&gt; and forward-compat with &lt;code&gt;7.x&lt;/code&gt;, but so far I've only tested on &lt;code&gt;6.5&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I left a few questions in the diff, marked with &lt;code&gt;todo&lt;/code&gt;. @desrosj, @birgire, can y'all take a look at those? There's mostly small docs issues. The only big change I think this might need is to refactor &lt;code&gt;wpPrivacyProcessPersonalDataExportPage.php&lt;/code&gt; to use a &lt;code&gt;@dataProvider&lt;/code&gt;, to avoid having a ton of tests with duplicated code.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;i&gt;Version&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Severity&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Thanks for the ticket @dingo_bastard
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Having the confirm key available within these filters seems useful.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Within &lt;code&gt;wp_send_user_request( $request_id )&lt;/code&gt; the request is fetched by request ID with &lt;code&gt;wp_get_user_request_data( $request_id )&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At that moment the confirm key has not been generated for the request.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Then the confirm key is generated by calling &lt;code&gt;wp_generate_user_request_key( $request_id )&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That means the request is updated and stores the confirm key in the &lt;code&gt;post_password&lt;/code&gt; field.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But then the request object, in the &lt;code&gt;$email_data&lt;/code&gt;, becomes "dirty" (not refreshed) so it's still with an empty confirm key.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At first glance it seems that possible fixes could be to:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Re-fetch the request object into the &lt;code&gt;$email_data&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only update the &lt;code&gt;confirm_key&lt;/code&gt; attribute, of the request object into the &lt;code&gt;$email_data&lt;/code&gt;. But there's currently no &lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt; method in &lt;code&gt;WP_User_Request&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Set the confirm key explicitly into &lt;code&gt;$email_data['confirm_key']&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;...
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
after the confirm key is generated.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Looks like there's no solution to this yet. In the meantime, can I request a filter inside the bulk_edit_posts function? Possibly around the part where the new categories are being merged with the old ones? (Line 566-570 in includes/post.php) So that a simpler plugin can be developed (without creating an entire bulk edit plugin) to allow users to completely override existing categories. I know it's an ugly bandaid on a serious wound, but I think it can be a temporary relief.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #44758 (The REST API is not respecting the user's locale properly.) updated</title>
      
        <dc:creator>TimothyBlynJacobs</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Thu, 13 Sep 2018 15:58:46 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44758#comment:21</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44758#comment:21/1536854326962033</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
How big of an issue are the untranslated post type labels for this? Happy to work on &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38218" title="#38218: enhancement: Make post type labels work during locale switching (closed: duplicate)"&gt;#38218&lt;/a&gt; in the next few weeks. I had a PoC patch lying around somewhere a while ago...
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Fairly important. Gutenberg uses the labels of post types and taxonomies to populate important parts of the editor interface. The current path works fine for the built-ins because they are re-registered, but if someone was using Gutenberg on a custom post type, or with custom taxonomies, they'd see this inconsistently translated interface.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Also, how much trouble would it cause to set the locale way earlier than now to circumvent this?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We had trouble identifying where, exactly, the translations for the request get set. &lt;code&gt;load_*_textdomain()&lt;/code&gt; seemed like critical functions, as did &lt;code&gt;_get_path_to_translation_from_lang_dir()&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sounds interesting. This is already used quite a bit in WordPress, so I'm sure we could DRY things up a bit. Not sure if we really need yet another filter for this... Essentially you only need the locale filter and the user meta filter for the locale. I wouldn't want to change this.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If we replaced those instances with a &lt;code&gt;determine_locale()&lt;/code&gt; like function, it wouldn't necessarily need to be filtered. We could inline the REST API locale detection code.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Assuming that part is feasible, the difficulties would be two fold.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We would need to do some trickery to determine whether this is a REST API request before &lt;code&gt;parse_request&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On rest requests, we would be loading the current user earlier than expected. Previously this [early loading](&lt;a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/29783#comment:50"&gt;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/29783#comment:50&lt;/a&gt;) would only happen on admin requests and the customizer. What potential fallout this might cause, I'm not sure.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Something like this:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;function determine_locale() {
	if ( ( is_multisite() &amp;amp;&amp;amp; get_blog_option( null, 'permalink_structure' ) ) || get_option( 'permalink_structure' ) ) {
		// Not actually accurate, needs to handle index permalinks and paths in the home url, etc...
		$is_rest = strpos( $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], '/' . rest_get_url_prefix() ) === 0;
	} else {
		$is_rest = isset( $_GET['rest_route'] );
	}
	if ( is_admin() ) {
		return get_user_locale();
	}
	if ( $is_rest &amp;amp;&amp;amp; isset( $_GET['_locale'] ) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; 'user' === $_GET['_locale'] &amp;amp;&amp;amp; is_user_logged_in() ) {
		return get_user_locale();
	}
	return get_locale();
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I suppose this could actually happen with the existing &lt;code&gt;locale&lt;/code&gt; filter. But we were confused whether that was the right solution or not. Particularly because a REST API locale seems very similar to how a different WP-Admin locale works, and that was implemented using the &lt;code&gt;is_admin() ? get_user_locale() : get_locale()&lt;/code&gt; switch instead of inside &lt;code&gt;get_locale()&lt;/code&gt; or a &lt;code&gt;locale&lt;/code&gt; filter. History in &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/29783" title="#29783: feature request: User Admin Language (closed: fixed)"&gt;#29783&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;
We are willing to do some architectural work for this, to lay out what we think would be a good way of generating these in WordPress.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thank you for the fantastic offer, your expertise in building sitemaps will be incredibly valuable.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Jetpack and WP.com have an XML sitemap implementation too
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I will review the Jetpack implementation, we have often started building core features by leveraging established open source solutions.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I need to change the look (and the url) of the link for the request personal data deletion/export, so I hooked to &lt;code&gt;user_request_action_email_content&lt;/code&gt; filter, and inspected the &lt;code&gt;$email_data&lt;/code&gt; so that I can get the request &lt;code&gt;ID&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;confirm_key&lt;/code&gt; in my email.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But upon inspecting the data provided I can see the confirmation key in the &lt;code&gt;confirm_url&lt;/code&gt; key of the &lt;code&gt;$email_data&lt;/code&gt;, but the field in the object is empty.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is intentional or a bug?

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Hi,
The issue is only with .mp3 and not with any other file formats(pdfs and other allowed media formats are fine). Im still trying to figure out if there is any correlation between different mp3 encodings,as if I convert mp3 to mp3 (using online converter) I have no issues (does not look like bitrate matter), I have checked .mp3 beforehand with the online mp3 checker and it did not report any errors. But only after I converted them with that online tool I was able to upload?!Still testing to be absolutely sure but so far that the only solution I can think of. Any ideas? It just does not make sense. Thank you!
&lt;/p&gt;

I think it would be nice to be explicit about the access modifier, so I added public to the methods where no access modifier was given

Hi @dingo_bastard, nice cache.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
one issue is there if any one use big name like &lt;strong&gt;Dashboardistotallycool&lt;/strong&gt; then text is overflow.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So I have made a patch that removes that overflow. i uses &lt;code&gt; word-break: break-word;&lt;/code&gt; css property.
&lt;/p&gt;

        <dc:creator>garrett-eclipse</dc:creator>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
And a last thought;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Would it be useful to have a &lt;code&gt;_doing_actions_wrong&lt;/code&gt; function to streamline things and make it elegant because &lt;code&gt;Code is Poetry&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It could possibly take three parameters;&lt;br /&gt;
string|array - The action(s) required by this function.&lt;br /&gt;
semvar - The version this requirement was introduced/updated&lt;br /&gt;
conditional - AND/OR - control if actions are dependent
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This would allow the translation to be consistent, adding a single string for i18n similar to;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/blob/56c162fbc9867f923862f64f1b4570d885f1ff03/wp-includes/functions.wp-scripts.php#L36-L52"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/blob/56c162fbc9867f923862f64f1b4570d885f1ff03/wp-includes/functions.wp-scripts.php#L36-L52&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This would simply call the &lt;code&gt;_doing_it_wrong&lt;/code&gt; function with standardized strings and the current &lt;span class="underline"&gt;FUNCTION&lt;/span&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

Thanks @swissspidy I appreciate the &lt;code&gt;2nd-opinion&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Replying to &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44937#comment:1" title="Comment 1"&gt;swissspidy&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This happens after &lt;code&gt;plugins_loaded&lt;/code&gt;, so the first time you can be sure that everything is set up is in the &lt;code&gt;init&lt;/code&gt; hook.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Just to confirm this specific case the load_*_textdomain should be called in the &lt;code&gt;init&lt;/code&gt; hook. &lt;br /&gt;
So the Codex example should update from &lt;code&gt;plugins_loaded&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;init&lt;/code&gt; - &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/load_plugin_textdomain#Examples"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/load_plugin_textdomain#Examples&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And would the recommended hooks for themes be valid? - &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/load_theme_textdomain"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/load_theme_textdomain&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Replying to &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44937#comment:1" title="Comment 1"&gt;swissspidy&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
IMO it's a rule of thumb that you shouldn't run any code directly without hooking into some action. This scenario with &lt;code&gt;load_*_textdomain()&lt;/code&gt; (which I know people run into from time to time) is just one example. And it's a known one. After all the blog post you linked to is over 8 years old :-)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Exposing this would be very helpful to theme/plugin developers where core functions are reliant on other actions.
Aside from localization anomalies, I'm sure others can add to the list of calling core functions too early in their plugin, theme, code.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I do see a use of the _doing_it_wrong function throughout core but wonder if it needs to become more of a convention.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Maybe an addition to the handbook on coding core functions to take into account reliance on actions. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/php/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/php/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
These warnings are helpful to developers especially when adopting new (maybe just to them) functions that are reliable on action hooks. It flags edge case issues such as i18n that developers may not catch and if action reliance ever changes due to new features such as user locales the warning can be updated which devs can catch in beta/RC.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A good example in core of _doing_it_wrong in context of actions hooks can be found in &lt;code&gt;_wp_scripts_maybe_doing_it_wrong&lt;/code&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/blob/56c162fbc9867f923862f64f1b4570d885f1ff03/wp-includes/functions.wp-scripts.php#L36-L52"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/blob/56c162fbc9867f923862f64f1b4570d885f1ff03/wp-includes/functions.wp-scripts.php#L36-L52&lt;/a&gt;

Indentation issue has been fixed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yesterday's office hours briefly touched on this. The end result was that two different notices are better to avoid people only reading the first half of a proposed notice that would contain both info.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
In the admin menu, if you add a name that is too long (or a text that has 17 characters) the arrow will cover the last character. Also if the text is 3 lines long (I know that menus shouldn't be that long) the text will go underneath the icon, which looks kinda ugly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So I have made a patch that removes float on the icons and uses &lt;code&gt;display: inline-block&lt;/code&gt;, with a set width of a text block.
&lt;/p&gt;

Hi @barryhanbury, welcome to WordPress Trac! Thanks for the report.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Could you provide a piece of code or the steps to reproduce the issue on a clean install? Does it still happen with all plugins disabled and a default theme (Twenty Seventeen) activated?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hi Sergey, thanks for your reply!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There is no code involved, just set up a clean install with default wp theme, 2017 or something, add enough "posts" fro pagination and then do site.com/post_type=post&amp;amp;paged=2
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I think this warning is a great idea. I wrote a plugin to overwrite some strings and it always fails, when the plugin just calls the &lt;code&gt;load_plugin_textdomain&lt;/code&gt; function outside of an action callback.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I'm unsure the root of the issue but I assume the plugin loads prior to the user so their locale isn't available when the MO object is loaded into the $l10n global.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That's the reason, yes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Plugins are loaded early in &lt;code&gt;wp-settings.php&lt;/code&gt;, way before the default translations are loaded and the current user is set up.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
See &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/blob/e29d895ffd7388fcb6c73c1c5f6057204096dc03/src/wp-settings.php#L307"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/blob/e29d895ffd7388fcb6c73c1c5f6057204096dc03/src/wp-settings.php#L307&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/blob/e29d895ffd7388fcb6c73c1c5f6057204096dc03/src/wp-settings.php#L404-L450"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/blob/e29d895ffd7388fcb6c73c1c5f6057204096dc03/src/wp-settings.php#L404-L450&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This happens after &lt;code&gt;plugins_loaded&lt;/code&gt;, so the first time you can be sure that everything is set up is in the &lt;code&gt;init&lt;/code&gt; hook.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Hello,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Came across a race condition when the load_plugin_textdomain is called (for lack of a better term) 'naked' in plugins, most recently Github Updater.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This only affects WP 4.7+ as it relates to the User Locale vs. the Site Locale within the admin area.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you call load_plugin_textdomain in your plugin outside of a init or plugins_loaded action then your plugin will load it's strings based on the site locale rather than the admin's locale.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The Codex - &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/load_plugin_textdomain"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/load_plugin_textdomain&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It provides an example using plugins_loaded but doesn't indicate any issue.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'm unsure the root of the issue but I assume the plugin loads prior to the user so their locale isn't available when the MO object is loaded into the $l10n global.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don't know if it's possible to make the user locale available to plugins running load_plugin_textdomain prior to init and since the issue isn't present prior to 4.7 feel a _doing_it_wrong prompt will help plugin developers avoid the pitfall.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I haven't tried with other plugins or examples but to reproduce;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Install clean WP
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Install GitHub Updater &amp;lt;8.3 - (8.2.1 - &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/afragen/github-updater/tree/8.2.1"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://github.com/afragen/github-updater/tree/8.2.1&lt;/a&gt;)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Set Site Locale to de_DE or fr_FR or ....
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Set User Locale to en_US
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Install all translations
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visit GitHub Updater dashboard
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;
And you'll find it's not in en_US it's in the site locale.
*If it's half en and half your site locale those are from missing strings on the site locale.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Then if you replace with 8.3+ (&lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/afragen/github-updater/tree/develop"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://github.com/afragen/github-updater/tree/develop&lt;/a&gt;) you'll find the panel in user locale as 8.3 fixed this issue by wrapping load_plugin_textdomain in a plugins_loaded action function.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And I'll wrap up with a concept snippet for the load_plugin_textdomain function;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;did_action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'init'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;did_action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'plugins_loaded'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;_doing_it_wrong&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'load_plugin_textdomain'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nb"&gt;sprintf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* translators: 1: function 2: init, 3: plugins_loaded */&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'The %1$s should be called from the %2$s or %3$ hooks.'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;load_plugin_textdomain&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;init&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;plugins_loaded&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'4.7.0'&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
And it seems I'm not alone;

      <title>Ticket #38218 (Make post type labels work during locale switching) updated</title>
      
        <dc:creator>swissspidy</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Thu, 13 Sep 2018 07:01:33 GMT</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Yeah so I added a PoC implementation two years ago for such a class: &lt;a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/26511/WP_Post_Type_Labels.diff"&gt;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/26511/WP_Post_Type_Labels.diff&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I imagined it to work like this:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Register a new post type A
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only define the &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; label and let &lt;code&gt;get_post_type_labels()&lt;/code&gt; provide the rest. (This is what many plugins do, in a nutshell)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;WP_Post_Type::$labels&lt;/code&gt; is a magic method that returns an array containing &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; plus any other labels provided on the fly by &lt;code&gt;get_post_type_labels()&lt;/code&gt;, either using a &lt;code&gt;WP_Post_Type_Label&lt;/code&gt; class or something else.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Register a new post type B
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pass a callback function to &lt;code&gt;labels&lt;/code&gt; that returns an array with a single key, &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;WP_Post_Type::$labels&lt;/code&gt; is a magic method that returns a merged array of the callback's result + any missing labels from &lt;code&gt;get_post_type_labels()&lt;/code&gt;. Again, the specifics of that are TBD.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
@swissspidy I got your point about the adoption of such as feature.
What bothers me is that I am not quite sure about the technical implementation. What is your exact idea about the callback? What I understand is WP_Post_Type object to have property labels pointing to function returning an array of labels and called on demand by WP_Post_Type_Labels::&lt;span class="underline"&gt;get() method?
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
We strongly agree that this should be in core. It's something we've put forth as a feature project before, which was accepted at that point but then sidelined because of Gutenberg. I've discussed it with @matt before as well because Jetpack and WP.com have an XML sitemap implementation too.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We are willing to do some architectural work for this, to lay out what we think would be a good way of generating these in WordPress.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
How big of an issue are the untranslated post type labels for this? Happy to work on &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38218" title="#38218: enhancement: Make post type labels work during locale switching (closed: duplicate)"&gt;#38218&lt;/a&gt; in the next few weeks. I had a PoC patch lying around somewhere a while ago...
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Also, how much trouble would it cause to set the locale way earlier than now to circumvent this?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is probably tangent, but it might be helpful here if all the occurences of &lt;code&gt;is_admin() ? get_user_locale() : get_locale()&lt;/code&gt; were replaced with a method something like
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sounds interesting. This is already used quite a bit in WordPress, so I'm sure we could DRY things up a bit. Not sure if we really need yet another filter for this... Essentially you only need the locale filter and the user meta filter for the locale. I wouldn't want to change this.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
@dontgo2sleep We can explore that in this ticket, but I see one big problem with this approach: it doesn't work for existing plugins.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are thousands of plugins registering post types and taxonomies out there. In order for things like the toolbar in the user's locale work, we need to solve this in a backward compatible way for all existing plugins.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The adoption rate for the callback variant would be way too slow without any additional benefit.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Also think about documentation, tutorials, etc. These won't be updated using the callback option for a long time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
However, we probably need &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; to fully solve this. We'll have to see how it goes.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
There is one option that is purely core implementation. Add the new action as the last thing in &lt;code&gt;get_header&lt;/code&gt;. Themes already are calling that and the header typically ends with the body tag (and a variable amount of tags after).
&lt;/p&gt;

Hi @hanheg, welcome to WordPress Trac! Thank you for testing Gutenberg.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Until Gutenberg is merged into core, we're tracking its issues on GitHub: &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg&lt;/a&gt;. Could you please report the issue there? Thanks again!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/42018" title="#42018: defect (bug): Can't Edit Image in RTL/Hebrew version of WordPress (closed: fixed)"&gt;#42018&lt;/a&gt; is closed as fixed in 4.9; it looks like the issue has reappeared since then.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That said, &lt;a class="reopened ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44911" title="#44911: defect (bug): TinyMCE pop-up box for adding links flickers and cant be clicked when ... (reopened)"&gt;#44911&lt;/a&gt; was submitted earlier, let's continue there.

&lt;p&gt;
This is not because of any plugins as i have removed all plugins and checked.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Does it still happen if you switch to the default theme (Twenty Seventeen)?
&lt;/p&gt;

Hi @lwright, welcome to WordPress Trac! Thanks for the report.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Does it still happen on a clean install with all plugins disabled and a default theme (Twenty Seventeen) activated?
&lt;/p&gt;

Hi @webgroup1, welcome to WordPress Trac! Thanks for the report.

&lt;p&gt;
The limit is set to 7MB.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The limit is set by your server configuration, not by WordPress. You'll need to increase &lt;code&gt;post_max_size&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;upload_max_filesize&lt;/code&gt; values in PHP settings.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Please try the support forums if you need further help with your site: &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://wordpress.org/support/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://wordpress.org/support/&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi @barryhanbury, welcome to WordPress Trac! Thanks for the report.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Could you provide a piece of code or the steps to reproduce the issue on a clean install? Does it still happen with all plugins disabled and a default theme (Twenty Seventeen) activated?
&lt;/p&gt;
