Weird, maybe I am confusing VIP QuickStart.  That said, I found the 1000+ line Bash provision script almost as problematic.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Hi everyone,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'd like to throw a new contender into the ring; &lt;em&gt;(currently named)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/wplib/wplib-box"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;WPLib Box&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/wplib/wplib-box/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A0.17.0"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;0.17.0&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We originally decided to build it because of frustrations with VVV. The fact VVV was provisioned locally using a 1000+ line Bash script that takes 30+ minutes to run, which often failed and required sysadmin level skills to debug meant that it was not a solution that developers with few sysadmin skills could trust.  Instead we wanted a box that “just worked,” so we built one that was pre-provisioned.  And as of &lt;code&gt;0.10.2&lt;/code&gt; it was really solid. That took us about a year, though not full time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Then we set our sites higher and decided to build a box that not only just worked but what capable of running any stack needed while still ensuring the most common use-cases were dead simple. And that lead us to planning the use of a set of orchestrated Docker containers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But what we found over the past year is that Docker for Mac has significant limitations, such as &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46286741/is-there-a-workaround-to-use-the-hosts-network-in-docker-for-mac"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;only being able to use the host’s network&lt;/a&gt; on Docker for Mac. This issue alone makes a pure implementation of orchestrated Docker containers a non-starter, assuming you want to make it “just work” for the developer installing it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That lead us back to using a Vagrant and VirtualBox with Docker containers. Thus the current version of WPLib Box is &lt;code&gt;0.16.2&lt;/code&gt; (with &lt;code&gt;0.16.3&lt;/code&gt; coming later this week, hopefully) and the current version is based on Ubunutu 14.04 LTS + Vagrant + VirtualBox + individual Docker containers inside.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But in reality Vagrant is very problematic, constantly breaking working boxes on updates and just persnickety when it comes to installation.  Further, Ubuntu is really memory intensive.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So our plans are to release &lt;code&gt;0.17.0&lt;/code&gt; in the near future, and it will be based on either Tiny Core Linux or Alpine, VirtualBox and &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/wplib?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;q=docker"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;many Docker containers&lt;/a&gt;. It will also come with both a Mac and a Windows installer where the goal is for it to be as easy to get working as any application you might download and install on your Mac or Windows computer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Looking back, we worked on &lt;code&gt;0.16.0&lt;/code&gt; for over a year and it was a huge release which changed the box from a LEMP VM to a VM designed to orchestrate Docker containers and it positions us for a relatively quick release for &lt;code&gt;0.17.0&lt;/code&gt;. In order to release sooner or later we will probably not implement all of our &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/wplib/wplib-box/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A0.17.0"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;current backlog of issues tagged for 0.17.0&lt;/a&gt; and instead implement a lot of them in &lt;code&gt;0.17.x&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Longer term, we even plan to get rid of VirtualBox, but that will require more than a short-term engineering effort.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now on to the requirements mentioned by everyone in this thread:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Replying to &lt;a class="new ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/43711" title="#43711: enhancement: Let's create a standard development setup for WordPress core. (new)"&gt;omarreiss&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Download and boot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the easiest possible development workflow: just download and boot.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;reliable: it should just work.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
From day 1 that has been a mantra for WPLib Box, that is “just works.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Integratingwatchandbuildbehavior"&gt;Integrating watch and build behavior&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As we plan to &lt;a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/43055"&gt;introduce a build step to the development workflow&lt;/a&gt;, it becomes more important that building is not an afterthought but something that is integrated into the development workflow.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A key aspect of WPLIb Box is its extensible architecture. With that architecture we will be able to easily implement and incorporate the build solution from &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/43055" title="#43055: enhancement: Reorganize Core JS / introduce build step (closed: fixed)"&gt;#43055&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
WPLib’s extensibility features as based on two concepts: “Stacks” and “Installables.”  Stacks allow implementing any conceivable set of services you need with the default one being “WordPress.” But there could be a “WordPress Develop” stack, a “Tide” stack, or hell, even a “Drupal” or Node Express” stack.  Stacks can extend other stacks and WPLib Box will be able to run multiple stacks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Stacks are comprised of one of more “Installables”, and an Installable can be anything that either a “Project” needs or that the Box needs globally.  Further, Installables can a Docker container, a WordPress plugin, a Theme, a SQL data file, or even a collection of those things. or a collections of other Installables. An Installable can even be a Stack.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Stacks and/or Installables required by a Project get written to a &lt;code&gt;project.json&lt;/code&gt; file that can be version controlled and shared so that when a team member, or another WordPress core contributor brings up a project they will automatically see the exact environment that was configured for them by the developer who committed the &lt;code&gt;project.json&lt;/code&gt; file.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Note WPLib Box &lt;code&gt;0.17.0&lt;/code&gt; will support multiple “Projects,” each being identified by a local domain, e.g. &lt;code&gt;example.local&lt;/code&gt; (we don’t call is a “multi-site” box for hopefully obvious reasons.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;fast: reduce build and boot times to a minimum.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You should download and try the current version to see for yourself. We’ve really made it to be very performant, and &lt;code&gt;0.17.0&lt;/code&gt; should only improve that.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
@pento noted that eventually he'd like this thing to be configurable and installable through a GUI in order to reduce the barrier of entry for new contributors to the absolute minimum.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Part of our architecture will be to have an Electron-based admin console.  It will run based on the API we are building into the box.  Assuming something very similar to Local by Flywheel.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Replying to &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/43711#comment:1" title="Comment 1"&gt;youknowriad&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ideally, the integration and e2e tests (even unit tests since PHP unit tests require a full setup) should use the same environment
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We are &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/wplib/wplib-box/issues/25#issuecomment-368401449"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;adding PHPUnit to the box&lt;/a&gt; by implementing a &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/wplib/wplib-box/issues/363"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;general-purpose PHP script container approach&lt;/a&gt; that will make adding PHP-script based solutions as easy as specifying the details in an &lt;code&gt;installable.json&lt;/code&gt; file.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
From that we should be able to create an Installable adds the integration and e2e test and then include them in the “WordPress Develop” stack.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A dev environment even if it's hidden behind magical scripts should stay simple. When bugs happen developers of any level should be able to understand, debug and tweak how the environment works.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Saying this a different way, our goal with WPLib Box is that the common case is dead simple, and the edge cases are possible.  We are focused on hiding Docker containers completely from everyone except those that want to interact with them and/or build their own Docker containers for WPLib Box.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We will be segmenting our UX to multiple levels:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;End-user developer:&lt;/strong&gt; All they will need to ever see and are the installer and Electron-based admin console.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Power-user developer:&lt;/strong&gt; In addition to the end-user developer they will also be interested in the &lt;code&gt;box&lt;/code&gt; command line tool that will work both in the box and also on the host. They will also be able to build simple installables such as a starting point for a website; e.g. WordPress core, a collection of plugins and a theme.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Front-end extension developer:&lt;/strong&gt; Beyond end- and power-user developer they will be able to extend the Electron-based admin using Vue.js and the Box API.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Box extension developer:&lt;/strong&gt; Beyond end- and power-user developer these people will be able to extend the box itself such as Installable containers and even Stacks, as well as adding commands to the &lt;code&gt;box&lt;/code&gt; CLI.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;
From the above segmentation we should be able to directly support hiding all complexity and make the end-user developer’s use very simple.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Replying to &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/43711#comment:4" title="Comment 4"&gt;Mte90&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One of the problems that has VVV right now is that require a lot of time on first start because of installation (and download of a lot of things) but the plan for version 3 (&lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/issues/1469"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/issues/1469&lt;/a&gt;) with a box that contain everything and also the parallel for the provision will improve a lot this point.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The current WPLib Box (&lt;code&gt;0.16.2&lt;/code&gt;) contains everything and boots in about 30 seconds.  We expect the next major version  (&lt;code&gt;0.17.0&lt;/code&gt;) will boot in around 5 seconds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The other problems that often at contributor day we have is Windows. Install virtualbox, vagrant, git on Windows is a big step because people do't know anything of them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We attend to hide the installation of VirtualBox via our installers.  We can also look into installing Git, or we can provide them Git access via &lt;code&gt;box git …&lt;/code&gt; which could be wrapped in a batch or Powershell file as just &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Often the problems on VVV is because there are different versions of powershell on the system (don't ask me why) and Vagrant or Virtualbox works with issue based on the version of ps.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For the most part this just won’t be an issue in &lt;code&gt;0.17.0&lt;/code&gt; given our architecture.  And our box command will be implemented in GoLang so that should resolve the cross platform issue.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With docker we will have more problems on Windows because we need a virtual machine so (virtualbox and git will be required in any case) so the only advantage that we don't have anymore the easy vagrant to use but docker (that is not so entry level).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Again, we are addressing all of this with an installer, a VM to contain and orchestrate the Docker containers, and a simple admin console to make things easy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sure, there is the VVV USB Generator that prepare all the executables for download (maybe also the latest image) but we need to think that at contributor day not everyone has an OS dev friendly for *nix stuff.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We will support Windows day one.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
From the other side VVV has the cool part to be used also for not contribute and very easy with vagrant up/halt and db backup so usually people are interested in that then contribute.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I would like to have is so that when someone adopts WPLib Box because of how easy it is that we make it just as easy for them to contribute to WordPress by giving them a menu option to just get started.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Integrating watch and build behavior: As we plan to &lt;a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/43055"&gt;introduce a build step to the development workflow&lt;/a&gt;, it becomes more important that building is not an afterthought but something that is integrated into the development workflow.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We plan to add watching/building as a default installable for our WordPress stack.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We have another mantra that is
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;"If we can simplify things for the end user and make it run in the box, we should make it run in the box."&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So our vision is to minimize the number of things developers have to (figure out how to) install and get working on their host machine, and that we instead deliver a default solution that "just works," but that is also configurable and extensible for their needs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
having access to a &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface&lt;/a&gt; (CLI) to run &lt;code&gt;grunt watch&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;grunt build&lt;/code&gt; tasks will be an important part of the WordPress development workflow.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We will certainly have installables for Grunt and Gulp though we plan to have WebPack + NPM scripts be the default build solution for WordPress (and WordPress Develop.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;WordPress' CLI commands and scripts will need to be compatible with Mac, Windows, and *nix operating systems
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;code&gt;box&lt;/code&gt; CLI will be compatible on Mac, Windows and *nix, and the build systems will be able to run in the box so the scripts we use will only need to run within our purpose-built containers &lt;em&gt;(which is the whole benefit of containers, right?)&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://getcomposer.org/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;Composer&lt;/a&gt; is required as this was recently added in &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/43558" title="#43558: enhancement: Add `composer.json` file for development dependencies (closed: fixed)"&gt;#43558&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;PHPCS&lt;/a&gt; support
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We already include support for &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/wplib/composer-docker"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;several versions of Composer&lt;/a&gt; in WPLib Box &lt;code&gt;0.16.2&lt;/code&gt;.

Any solution would require a provisioning script to set up the database user and the relevant files, as well as perform checks that relevant tools are installed. This would seem to be a more portable approach that needs to be taken anyway regardless of what devops gets done.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
WPLib Box currently provisions the database on first load, and a package of Installables should support all of this.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
One of the most valuable things that Docker has done is to popularise the "container" concept: small, disposable, task-oriented VMs that are designed to spin up quickly, perform a single task well, and can be cheaply reset. This encourages tasks to be performed in the environment they most make sense: if something needs disk performance (eg, &lt;code&gt;watch&lt;/code&gt;-type tasks), it can be run on the host. If something requires specialised software or configuration (eg, a MySQL database), it can be run inside of a container.
This directly benefits the contributor experience: isolating the magic to little boxes that can't be easily broken (and can be easily reset in the event they are) reduces the cost of experimenting, knowing that you have a fast and reliable reset mechanism to fall back on. Drawing from my personal experience,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I cannot agree more. That is exactly why we chose to architect WPLib Box as a collection of orchestrated containers rather than try and create one big behemoth Docker container containing everything.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
VVV has the opposite experience: provisioning is a slow process, which discourages resetting, which makes experimenting a risky proposition.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yet again, agreed. That opposite experience is exactly why we first started to build WPLib Box.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lightweight.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Check. See above.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Disposable.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
WPLib Box is currently designed to be disposable.  In &lt;code&gt;0.17.0&lt;/code&gt; we plan to continue that, if for no other reason than that will make upgrades trivial.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Centrally manageable.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Swappable components &lt;em&gt;(such as for PHP)&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Check.  We will be managing containers centrally and will have the open to auto-update; currently you can run &lt;code&gt;box self-update&lt;/code&gt; in version &lt;code&gt;0.16.2&lt;/code&gt; and it does essentially that.  And swapping is just changing the name of the PHP container in the &lt;code&gt;projects.json&lt;/code&gt; file
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Further, given our architecture the WordPress core team could manage their own &lt;em&gt;"WordPress Develop"&lt;/em&gt; Stack &lt;em&gt;(basically a list of Installable containers and other installables)&lt;/em&gt; and those containers could either extend ours &lt;em&gt;(to make it quick and simple to get the this Stack started)&lt;/em&gt; or they could replace ours if the core team's needs are more urgent than we can respond and/or if the core team needs something that makes no sense to include in our standard WPLib Box containers.

If our end goal is to make it really easy, the same way WordPress made website create easy 😜 we should aim higher
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Absolutely.  WPLib Box’s core mantra is “It just works” and everything we do is filtered with the lens of getting us there by version 1.0
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://c9.io/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://c9.io/&lt;/a&gt; – a web IDE now run by Amazon AWS (Janitor uses it).
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I really hope we don’t decide to go there. I have tried using C9, and it cannot compare to a solid local experience with PHPStorm+XDEBUG.  I don’t know about others, but if contributing to WordPress required using c9, I would never even consider it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That said, if c9 were an &lt;em&gt;optional&lt;/em&gt; approach for newbies, that might make sense.  More on this &lt;em&gt;"optional"&lt;/em&gt; idea below.

&lt;p&gt;
web-based development environments require a continuous, reasonably stable internet connection.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Absolutely. A local solution that requires no internet connection is ideal.  Which is how we've configured WPLib Box.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adding config for popular editors is a good idea. Mandating the editor is not.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Plus+1 for a WPLib Box Installable.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Storing GitHub/SVN/whatever credentials in the cloud is... less than ideal. 🙃 Requiring re-authentication for every commit is a terrible UX.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Agreed.  SSH passthru from host is better.  Auto-managing SSH in the box for those who do not already have set up is an even more ideal approach &lt;em&gt;(which we want to implement with a Installable container.)&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fits existing uses. Primarily, core development, Gutenberg development (as a model for future core development), and can be easily setup at contributor days.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Check:  &lt;code&gt;0.16.2&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is built with future uses in mind. Either container or full VM configurations can be relatively easily translated to online development environments, or to testing environments like calypso.live.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Check: &lt;code&gt;0.17.0&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All that said, if you made it to this point I greatly appreciate it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What I do notice on this ticket is there are now three (3) solutions vying for adoption:  VVV, some abstract Docker solution, and now WPLib Box.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So my proposal is this: Rather than make a hard and fast decision on one solution, why not leverage the competition inherent in the market and instead &lt;strong&gt;establish a set of requirements&lt;/strong&gt; that any recommended solution will need to provide, and then provide a recommended list of solution based on which one meets all &lt;em&gt;(or most)&lt;/em&gt; of those objectives?  That way you won't be shutting the door on a solution that might end up being significantly better simply by agreeing to choose one early one?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And if the core team later chooses to adopt just one as the &lt;em&gt;"official"&lt;/em&gt; version then you will have the option of picking the one that evolved to be the best and not just the one that was anointed early on?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I'm slightly confused as to the direction of this ticket, sorry. I've had a quick skim through the recent discussion here but how come the original patch that was suggested is no longer valid here? The original direction is to add a filter and it seems it's shifted into wrapper classes for a different purpose?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sorry, I can see how I made it confusing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To hopefully clarify I made an alternate proposal in &lt;a class="new ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/43740" title="#43740: enhancement: Filter WP_Post methods (vs. removing final/'get_post' filter) (new)"&gt;#43740&lt;/a&gt; but soon after realized &lt;strong&gt;there are really two (2) use-cases&lt;/strong&gt; and that &lt;strong&gt;the original use-case in this ticket is valid for custom post types&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So I am proposing we continue with a modified version of this ticket as per &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12955#comment:76" title="Comment 76"&gt;comment:76&lt;/a&gt; and also that we implement the hooks identified in &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12955#comment:69" title="Comment 69"&gt;comment:96&lt;/a&gt; as proposed in &lt;a class="new ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/43740" title="#43740: enhancement: Filter WP_Post methods (vs. removing final/'get_post' filter) (new)"&gt;#43740&lt;/a&gt;.

I noticed a small glitch while activating any theme on the Appearance &amp;gt; Themes page. When you click Activate, the &lt;code&gt; .themes.wp-clearfix&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt; .theme-browser&lt;/code&gt; div either shrinks or expands a small amount. This issue only shows up on Chrome, Firefox does not have this issue.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To recreate the issue:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Open latest Chrome browser
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Go to Appearance &amp;gt; Themes
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Click Activate on any theme and watch as the themes shrink or expand
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This glitch will not show while the "New theme activated" notification is showing, so it does not happen again after activating a theme. Unless you reload the page without the notification.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Seems to be an &lt;code&gt; Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected string&lt;/code&gt; on the Themes page
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/43967/43967.6.diff" title="Attachment '43967.6.diff' in Ticket #43967"&gt;43967.6.diff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/43967/43967.6.diff" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt; has the changes noted below.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Should the tests check the user_request_action_confirmed action works properly?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don't know that I have seen any tests before verifying that an action hook fires successfully (except the tests for the hooks API).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Should the tests check that _wp_admin_notified is updated on the request post?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Added tests for this.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Should the tests be duplicated for erasure requests?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Should the tests try and confirm a completed request?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
See &lt;a class="assigned ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44234" title="#44234: enhancement: Add missing unit tests for erasing personal data by username or email ... (assigned)"&gt;#44234&lt;/a&gt; for erasure request related tests.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Should any tests try to trigger the user_request_action_confirmed by loading the login page with confirmaction?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I couldn't find any tests for anything similar. May be worth investigating tests for the &lt;code&gt;wp-login.php&lt;/code&gt; page separately.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Should any tests be done when the request doesn’t exist or was removed somehow?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Added assertions for the early returns in the function (an invalid post ID is provided, or an ID that is not of the &lt;code&gt;user_request&lt;/code&gt; post type).
&lt;/p&gt;

@azaozz When I remove that code it does work for me! Thanks for the help! Do you have any idea when 4.9.7 might be released?

Think I found the problem. @danielbachhuber @bdanzer29 can you see if 44134-test.diff fixes it for you? It removes the "old" way of loading external plugins that doesn't seem needed any more.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;i&gt;Keywords&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
+1 for not generating and sending a ZIP when no data is found for a user.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
@birgire the patch looks good overall and just needs a refresh. Here is some general feedback.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can we change the &lt;code&gt;wp_privacy_send_personal_data_export_email()&lt;/code&gt; documentation to make note that an email is sent to a user if no data is found.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;wp_privacy_personal_data_email_content&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;bool&lt;/code&gt; type for the new parameter is misaligned.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; A &lt;code&gt;@since 4.9.7&lt;/code&gt; tag should be added to the &lt;code&gt;wp_privacy_send_personal_data_export_email()&lt;/code&gt; function and &lt;code&gt;wp_privacy_personal_data_email_content&lt;/code&gt; filter noting the introduction of the new &lt;code&gt;$has_data_export&lt;/code&gt; parameter.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Also, is there any reason a plugin would want to override the value of &lt;code&gt;$has_data_export&lt;/code&gt;? If so, a filter could be added there.
&lt;/p&gt;

Thanks for the patch, @XpertOne! Welcome to Trac!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/44139/44139.diff" title="Attachment '44139.diff' in Ticket #44139"&gt;44139.diff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/44139/44139.diff" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt; is the right format to provide a patch. Can we change it to only introduce a context for each string (leave both strings as "About") per @swissspidy's &lt;a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44139#comment:6"&gt;suggestion&lt;/a&gt;?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Also, the context in the patch still does not describe the context very well. Maybe "Page title of the about WordPress page in the admin." and "Header for the About section in a personal data export, which contains general site details."?
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>wontfix: &lt;p&gt;
After discussing this during the recent bug scrub, for now, it's something that is plugin territory. The About page is not explicitly sending the IP as data.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If this level of hardening is desired, the &lt;code&gt;admin_init&lt;/code&gt; hook can be used to redirect users to an alternate about page, and the URL in the admin bar can be changed in a number of ways.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
For me this seem to be a problem of Themes or Plugins calling the Function get_the_content() outside of the Loop.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So if you call it outside the loop the global $pages = null
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are some easy fixes for this error: Don't call the function from outside of the loop! :) And if you see a theme or plugin that is doing that, ask the developers to fix it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
or we could check $pages for null and return an empty string right at the begining of the function.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;function get_the_content( $more_link_text = null, $strip_teaser = false ) {
	global $page, $more, $preview, $pages, $multipage;
        if (is_null($pages)) { return ''; }    // new line
	$post = get_post();
....

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
the old ticket adds the generic functionality to exclude pre/code tags from convert_smilies.
but it uses a weak regex which didn't handle html attributes on these tags.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
this patch fixes the feature introduced in &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16448" title="#16448: enhancement: Smilies should not be placed inside of pre or code tags (closed: fixed)"&gt;#16448&lt;/a&gt; by modifying the regex

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Hi there! I'm not sure if I found a bug or this is intended behaviour: If  I use a combination of &lt;code&gt;childless&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;child_of&lt;/code&gt; in a &lt;code&gt;get_terms&lt;/code&gt; call, I get zero results.
My taxonomy's structure:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;- Genre
-- Hip Hop
-- Trap
-- Rap
- Location
-- Europe
--- Germany
--- Sweden
--- Austria
-- Asia
--- China
--- Japan
--- Taiwan
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
My code:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I'm trying to only list countries, basically children of 'location' that don't have children of their own.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Uses &lt;code&gt;assertSame()&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;assertEquals()&lt;/code&gt;, for stricter checks.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Changes &lt;code&gt;@since 5.0.0&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;@since 4.9.6.&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;anonymization.php&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adjusts the &lt;code&gt;test_anonymize_with_filter()&lt;/code&gt;, so it removes only the filter callback that was added, before the assertions.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adjusts the &lt;code&gt;filter_wp_privacy_anonymize_data()&lt;/code&gt; so it also tests the &lt;code&gt;$data&lt;/code&gt; input argument.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adjusts the inline docblock for &lt;code&gt;filter_wp_privacy_anonymize_data()&lt;/code&gt;:  adds a &lt;code&gt;@since&lt;/code&gt; and adds the variable to the &lt;code&gt;@return&lt;/code&gt; line.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
ps: I noticed that &lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/44141/44141.diff" title="Attachment '44141.diff' in Ticket #44141"&gt;44141.diff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/44141/44141.diff" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt; changes the email anonymization as well. Should the ticket be adjusted to mention that as well?

      <title>Ticket #44268 (GDPR concerns on the core commenting flow) updated</title>
      
        <dc:creator>asadkn</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Wed, 30 May 2018 15:15:21 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44268#comment:10</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44268#comment:10/1527693321972674</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
There's a lot of misinformation around &lt;em&gt;consent&lt;/em&gt;. There are six other lawful basis in EU GDPR law and legitimate interest does cover things like functional needs of software or network security.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Unless the email is going to be used for something else like marketing (bundled form), there’s simply no reason for consent for WordPress comments. Storing personal data in a cookie was more of a concern since it's not really a necessity but an enhancement, and stores the data in a less secure format that's a cookie - WordPress has that covered already now.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In many unbundled forms like these, submitting the form itself is consent. You obviously have to mention it in your Privacy Policy, but there's no need for consent. In the comment form:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;IP address is recorded for network security, spam etc. (Data retention shouldn’t be more than needed though)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Name is basic functional need for comments.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Email is needed for avatar, spam prevention, and perhaps duplication/flood checks etc. (Though, WordPress should have an option to make email optional here if the site owner decides not to use it for anything)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;
What I believe will be helpful:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A message to meet right to be informed. This can be a statement below the comment form with a link to privacy policy such as (just a quick example, not concrete): "When adding a comment, your email addresses will be used to display your Gravatar and your name will be displayed. Review our Privacy Policy."
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Data retention policies on IP address for comments.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <pubDate>Wed, 30 May 2018 14:32:10 GMT</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
You are right! That's the reason I proposed an alternative way that will create a separate backup on the server and the URLs in &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; will point to this location only. Everything in this file remain the same only except the file location will be different than we have now. This will definitely prevent us from sending large attachments! In fact, we don't have to worry about sending any additional attachment except the one (&lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt;) WordPress is sending now.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Also since the backup will be kept for only a stipulated period and will be erased after that, server space will not get overused for long time. Users will be notified about the time frame he has to download before it gets removed physically from the server for ever.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Does this make any sense?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Replying to &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44261#comment:3" title="Comment 3"&gt;allendav&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I worry about large attachments making the ZIPs ridiculous, so if we did something like this, let's consider having settings or at least filters controlling the maximum size attachment that can be added and also controlling the maximum size export ZIP we are willing to create.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
The variable is defined in a filter which uses str_replace to change it, this works fine and removing the filter doesn't affect the above, as I said, adding the variable to the slug breaks the page permalinks across the site.
&lt;/p&gt;

I am registering my script through mce_external_plugins filter.

Edit: Also wanted to add that even if I add a later priority to the filter I still get the same issue.

      <title>Ticket #44278 (Smileys got rendered inside pre/code tags in case html attributes are ...) created</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
hi!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
in case "raw" content is posted in a pre tag, legacy smiley sequences are processed by the convert_smilies function and converted to images, even if the html tags are in the &lt;strong&gt;$tags_to_ignore&lt;/strong&gt; list.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
this is caused by a weak regex inside the function which didn't take care of html attributes
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;current behaviour&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;a style="padding:0; border:none" href="https://media.andidittrich.de/wp-trac/current.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://media.andidittrich.de/wp-trac/current.png" alt="https://media.andidittrich.de/wp-trac/current.png" crossorigin="anonymous" title="https://media.andidittrich.de/wp-trac/current.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;expected behaviour&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;a style="padding:0; border:none" href="https://media.andidittrich.de/wp-trac/expected.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://media.andidittrich.de/wp-trac/expected.png" alt="https://media.andidittrich.de/wp-trac/expected.png" crossorigin="anonymous" title="https://media.andidittrich.de/wp-trac/expected.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;example content to reproduce the issue&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;hello :)
this is sourcecode and should not contain smiley images:
&amp;lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="js"&amp;gt;alert(':)');
// :)&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;
and text :(
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
attached a fixed version which is taking care of additional html attributes
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
best regards, Andi
&lt;/p&gt;

Where is this variable defined? Most WordPress variables have names that start with &lt;code&gt;wp_&lt;/code&gt;.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
@azaozz I'm simply registering &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://gist.github.com/danielbachhuber/7994605866299c57e2d9f9bac021f423"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;this GitHub Gist&lt;/a&gt; with the following:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;public static function filter_mce_external_plugins( $plugins ) {
	$assets_path           = dirname( dirname( __FILE__ ) ) . '/assets';
	$assets_url            = plugins_url( 'assets', __DIR__ );
	$filepath              = '/js/tinymce-plugin.js';
	$mtime                 = filemtime( $assets_path . $filepath );
	$plugins['tastylinks'] = $assets_url . $filepath . '?v=' . (int) $mtime;
	return $plugins;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
My TinyMCE plugin closely parallels wplink, so I'm not sure why wplink works and my TinyMCE plugin doesn't.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;(function(tinymce){
	tinymce.ui.Factory.add( 'WPTastyLinkPreview', tinymce.ui.Control.extend( {
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
vs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;( function( tinymce ) {
	tinymce.ui.Factory.add( 'WPLinkPreview', tinymce.ui.Control.extend( {
&lt;/pre&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I believe this is a WP bug, I have got help from other sources to see if it was my code causing the error and we can't find anything that will cause it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I then used a brand new install of WP to test if it's something in my code that I may have missed and get the same result.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Not sure what else I can do, we have done everything we can to try and fix it in our code and got no where.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don't think it's necessary to store an array of the fields that were anonymized instead the boolean that you have in your patch. IMO, the point of anonymizing is to remove any indication of who made the comment in the first place. In that regard, it &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be helpful to know that it was anonymized for overall tracking purposes, but it doesn't matter what specifically about the comment was anonymized.
&lt;/p&gt;

@allendav : if we want to keep the code simple and ignore the keys then we can just append the data to the result array (see 44151.3.patch).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think we should probably flag that as doingitwrong
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'm not sure what the expected result of this would be. Could you elaborate? I looked into &lt;code&gt;_doing_it_wrong&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;wp_send_json_error&lt;/code&gt; but the former doesn't work while doing AJAX, and the latter prevents the whole download from happening.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;i&gt;Keywords&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
@danielbachhuber @bdanzer29 confirmed that &lt;code&gt;tinymce.ui.Control&lt;/code&gt; is not available before TinyMCE is initialized. This seems to be a change in TinyMCE 4.7.0 and is the same in TinyMCE 4.7.13.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
However in my testing the theme seems to always be loaded and initialized first, before the plugins (at least in the default editors in WP, the main editor and the Text widget).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'm not sure if this will be "fixed" upstream. Also not sure why your plugins are running before TinyMCE and the theme are initialized. Please add any additional info on how to reproduce this, if possible.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I have a post type which we rewrite a custom url using the following:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;'slug' =&amp;gt; '%kh_product_cat%',
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It used to work but not sure when but it stopped working and although the post type url's work, the page url's don't.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Take that line out and the page url's work again, tested on a clean install of WP to make sure and get the same problem.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Has something been changed in WP recently which would affect this?
&lt;/p&gt;

I also get the same issue as @danielbachhuber with tinymce.ui.Control not working.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Right, think we should close &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44272" title="#44272: defect (bug): tinymce.ui.Control not working since WordPress 4.9.6 (closed: duplicate)"&gt;#44272&lt;/a&gt; as duplicate.

      <title>Ticket #44276 (Add AppVeyor Windows-based CI (Continuous Integration) Service) created</title>
      
        <dc:creator>netweb</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Wed, 30 May 2018 10:21:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44276</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44276/1527675660419870</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
AppVeyor is a Windows-based CI (Continuous Integration) Service &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://www.appveyor.com/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://www.appveyor.com/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With issues arising such as &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44262" title="#44262: defect (bug): Build tools: &amp;#34;grunt watch&amp;#34; throws fatal error on Windows (closed: fixed)"&gt;#44262&lt;/a&gt; (Build tools: "grunt watch" throws fatal error on Windows)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
By adding AppVeyor we can hopefully prevent some basic issues when running WordPress' &lt;em&gt;build tools&lt;/em&gt; on Windows-based platforms.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In future iterations, we can investigate further &lt;em&gt;build tools&lt;/em&gt; testing, be it Grunt tasks, Webpack, PHPCS, or PHPUnit
&lt;/p&gt;

Once the forthcoming patch has been committed the following is required to set up the GitHub and Slack integrations for the &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop&lt;/a&gt; repo :

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;

I should say at this point that in the future it would be great if you could &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;report security-related issues to the project's HackerOne program&lt;/a&gt; instead of here on the public issue tracker. This particular issue is just hardening, but it's always better to be safe than sorry.

Thanks for the report and the patch @BjornW!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;mt_rand()&lt;/code&gt; is also used in &lt;code&gt;update_option_new_admin_email()&lt;/code&gt; for the same purpose, so this instance will need to be changed too.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;md5()&lt;/code&gt; is only used here as a hashing function, not for a cryptographic purpose. The randomness comes from &lt;code&gt;(mt|wp)_rand()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;md5()&lt;/code&gt; just converts the result into a user-facing, URL-safe format. If the hash was successfully reverse engineered it wouldn't expose any information that isn't already stored along side it in the &lt;code&gt;adminhash&lt;/code&gt; option.
&lt;/p&gt;

Unless I'm missing something, there will still be an HTTP request to an unavailable resource before switching to fallback, leading to a slower, not faster experience.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ah I see. Yes, this is a consideration. There are a number of ways this could be mitigated:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;When the CDN doesn't respond, a cache value could be set to not bother trying it again for a predetermined amount of time, perhaps indefinitely. As soon as the local version of jQuery is loaded, there is no longer a case for trying to provide the client with the CDN version. The cache value could include country data which would prevent future users from the same country experiencing this problem.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There could be an option to unset a constant that would allow people to disable the CDN in their wp-config. E.g. something like &lt;code&gt;define( 'WP_USE_CDN', false );&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I think in the vast majority of cases, the CDN option would work fine, save a lot of energy and represent an improvement for most users.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>wontfix: &lt;p&gt;
I believe this change has too high a chance to break something that is relying on the user cap check returning true when the cap check is an empty array. If some malicious code can affect the return value of the &lt;code&gt;map_meta_cap&lt;/code&gt; filter, then it can effectively allow anything on the site anyway.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thanks for the report @dugi digitaly. It lead to a few improvements in the core code and in the unit tests.

You can already do that by filtering the &lt;code&gt;comment_form_defaults&lt;/code&gt; and adapting the  &lt;code&gt;comment_notes_before&lt;/code&gt; or  adding &lt;code&gt;comment_notes_after&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;
It looks like this warning is coming from the &lt;code&gt;do_meta_boxes()&lt;/code&gt; function. The &lt;code&gt;$context&lt;/code&gt; parameter should be escaped with &lt;code&gt;esc_attr()&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;htmlspecialchars()&lt;/code&gt;.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Apologies for not being clear enough in my initial wording - our concerns are that the file has no access control on it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
How guessable the file name is bears no relevance, as secure by obscurity is not secure. Once the file has been created anyone can access it and download it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As Wordpress is an open source CMS and by default the code is open, it would therefore not be too difficult to reverse engineer how the file is created to build a script to exploit it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There is also a potential issue with using index.html as a way to block directory viewing of the personal data folder, as any server that is configured to not default to index.html would be exposed. Although, i do appreciate that catering for server configurations is a difficult task. Ideally using .htaccess to block all public access to this folder is preferred, then any developer using nginx only setups would need to copy the rules into the nginx config.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Have you got any source for this? I know of no such ruling and have not been able to find any German article that mentions it. All German articles on the topic of IP anonymization seem talk about killing the last octet (or using Google's standard &lt;code&gt;_anonymizeIp()&lt;/code&gt; function).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Somebody mentioned this few weeks ago in Slack (I think) but can't find anything more about it either. Thinking we can consider this as "not real unless proven otherwise" :)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I am not aware of any court rulings, but the consideration about a potential requirement of cutting to only the first two octets (IPv4) may stem from the EU Article 29 Working Group's &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2008/wp148_en.pdf"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;Opinion paper WP148&lt;/a&gt; (2008):
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;"Currently, some search engine providers truncate IPv4 addresses by removing the final octet, thus in effect retaining information about the user's ISP or subnet, but not directly
identifying the individual. The activity could then originate from any of 254 IP addresses. &lt;strong&gt;This may not always be enough to guarantee anonymisation&lt;/strong&gt;."&lt;/em&gt; (emphasis mine)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The "Unabhängiges Landeszentrum für Datenschutz Schleswig-Holstein", one of Germany's 16 Federal Data Protection Authorities references that text in their &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://www.datenschutzzentrum.de/artikel/575-IP-Adressen-und-andere-Nutzungsdaten-Haeufig-gestellte-Fragen.html"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;FAQ on IP addresses (in German)&lt;/a&gt; to suggest obfuscation of two octets as acceptable.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is the opinion of public advisory bodies on data protection, not binding law; deleting the last octet appears to indeed be common practice in Germany, though some sources (legal blogs, mainly) tend to recommend deleting two. Since privacy compliance is always about minimising risk, not absolute rules, I believe that at least a filter to set a higher anonymization level could be worth considering?
&lt;/p&gt;

Hi @allendav ,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thanks for explain that and sorry for my bad ticket.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Effectively it's a misunderstanding what is for this checkbox.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But that doesn't take away the fact that you need a checkbox for the consent of data storage on the site, before the user comment.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Best regard.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Patrice
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There is no such thing as a bad ticket - well, at least this isn't one :)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think it will be good to resolve this matter (either way) and this ticket will be a good thread to capture that discussion and resolution.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
WordPress has already begun its compliance with data export capability, as well as other data related functions, and the creation of a privacy policy page.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Why stop there?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Data management concerns comments (among others), but it is not complete without this consent management.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Replying to &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44268#comment:6" title="Comment 6"&gt;allendav&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Providing a required checkbox and prompt concerning personal data processing before enabling the comment button presumes that a majority of site owners will be relying on consent as their lawful basis for processing comments. In core we are endeavoring to provide tools to assist the majority of sites with GDPR requirements, and it isn’t clear that a majority requires this basis. This particular use case might be better served by a plugin that extends the existing comment form.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the other hand, I do wonder if the majority would be served by adding static text, with a link to the privacy policy, at the bottom of the comment form. The text would be filterable and could be un-hooked if desired, e.g.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Under wp-admin/includes/, the call needs to be changed from
htmlspecialchars($context))
to
htmlspecialchars($context, $flags=NULL, $encoding='UTF-8'))
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Otherwise, there are constant debug warnings:
htmlspecialchars(): charset   not supported, assuming utf-8
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I've had those warnings for themes twenty-fourteen and twenty-seventeen, using only 2 active plugins Query Monitor and Really Simple SSL.

      <title>Ticket #43998 (REST API: Permit unbounded per_page=-1 requests for authorized users) updated</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Based on discussions in the REST API weekly meeting last week, we may be able to avoid this depending on the UI solutions implemented in Gutenberg. That said, I went ahead and did some work on it just in case we end up needing to go this route.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I pushed some working changes up to a new branch on @danielbachhuber 's git fork for anyone who wants to follow or add to it:

Sounds to me like ACF and CMB2 are hooking into &lt;code&gt;save_post&lt;/code&gt; rather than &lt;code&gt;save_post_{$post-&amp;gt;post_type}&lt;/code&gt;, and so have not yet saved the metadata to the postmeta table by the time &lt;code&gt;save_post_{$post-&amp;gt;post_type}&lt;/code&gt; runs.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #44273 (page routing problems) created</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
With the 4.9.6 update I have pages that are routing to blank pages with HTTP/1.1 200 OK
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;[local@KnownHost ~]$ curl -IL https://www.felixandfingers.com/blog-projects/
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Tue, 29 May 2018 20:45:37 GMT
Server: Apache
X-Powered-By: PHP/5.6.31
Cache-Control: max-age=0
Expires: Tue, 29 May 2018 20:45:37 GMT
Vary: Accept-Encoding
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
[local@KnownHost ~]$ curl https://www.felixandfingers.com/blog-projects/
[local@KnownHost ~]$
-----
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
That would lead me to suspect that something's wrong within WordPress's page router, and it's not routing to the correct page. No errors are generated, as I monitored all error_log files in the document root as well as the primary Apache error log, and no errors were triggered. It seems to be entirely a WordPress malfunction at this point.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I have other examples of pages if needed.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
When I add a breakpoint in the javascript logger the tinymce.ui I get only factory functions and nothing else. This mce plugin worked fine in the WordPress 4.9.5 version.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #44268 (GDPR concerns on the core commenting flow) updated</title>
      
        <dc:creator>allendav</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Tue, 29 May 2018 23:02:48 GMT</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Providing a required checkbox and prompt concerning personal data processing before enabling the comment button presumes that a majority of site owners will be relying on consent as their lawful basis for processing comments. In core we are endeavoring to provide tools to assist the majority of sites with GDPR requirements, and it isn’t clear that a majority requires this basis. This particular use case might be better served by a plugin that extends the existing comment form.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the other hand, I do wonder if the majority would be served by adding static text, with a link to the privacy policy, at the bottom of the comment form. The text would be filterable and could be un-hooked if desired, e.g.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
"Before submitting your comment, please read our privacy policy."
&lt;/p&gt;

apparently &lt;code&gt;grunt watch&lt;/code&gt; is implemented using &lt;code&gt;grunt-contrib-watch&lt;/code&gt;. We have a similar system in place for our plugin but it uses &lt;code&gt;webpack --watch --watch-poll&lt;/code&gt;, which is able to overcome this issue somehow
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I created an issue inside VVV's repo too: &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/issues/1531"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/issues/1531&lt;/a&gt;. Creating an issue here in case this issue can be fixed from the WP side. If not, feel free to invalidate this, it will probably still be good to have a record of this IMO.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Expected Behavior&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since WordPress' new build process was introduced (see &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/05/16/preparing-wordpress-for-a-javascript-future-part-1-build-step-and-folder-reorganization/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/05/16/preparing-wordpress-for-a-javascript-future-part-1-build-step-and-folder-reorganization/&lt;/a&gt;) we should be running grunt watch which should copy the changes made from the src directory into the build one.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Current Behavior&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
However, in VVV, when you make a change to a file (from your host machine or inside the VM) that's in a shared directory, grunt doesn't notice the change.
Possible Solution
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is probably because of &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/10660"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/10660&lt;/a&gt; (so it's a Virtual box issue). BUt I'm reporting here in case someone else has this issue and is looking for a fix, and it's possible we might find some workaround for VVV.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Steps to Reproduce&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Do git clone &lt;a class="ext-link" href="git://develop.git.wordpress.org/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;git://develop.git.wordpress.org/&lt;/a&gt; from inside VVV's www shared folder
from inside there, run npm install &amp;amp;&amp;amp; grunt build. Then grunt watch. Wait until it says it's "Waiting..."
Edit a file from inside src
Notice that the grunt task doesn't acknowledge that change, nor update the corresponding file in build
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Context&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I've been using the same WP develop checkout for both developing a few plugins, and for the occasional core contribution. So for developing plugins I will probably put my wp-content folder outside of the normal WP src folder, and use define( 'WP_CONTENT_DIR', dirname( dirname(&lt;span class="underline"&gt;FILE&lt;/span&gt;) ) . '/content' ); define( 'WP_CONTENT_URL', '&lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://dev.local/content"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://dev.local/content&lt;/a&gt;' );) so that I don't need to wait for grunt watch to copy all my changes from src to build everytime. But I'm currently a bit stuck for WP core contributions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Your Environment&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
VVV version: 2.1.0
VVV Git Branch: master (commit 710f085)
Vagrant version: 2.0.2
VM Provider name: Virtual Box
VM Provider version: 5.1.32
Operating System and version: Windows 7
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hi @allendav ,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thanks for explain that and sorry for my bad ticket.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Effectively it's a misunderstanding what is for this checkbox.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But that doesn't take away the fact that you need a checkbox for the consent of data storage on the site, before the user comment.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Best regard.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Patrice
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There is no such thing as a bad ticket - well, at least this isn't one :)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think it will be good to resolve this matter (either way) and this ticket will be a good thread to capture that discussion and resolution.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #44270 (Non-public custom post types have rewrite rules enabled by default) created</title>
      
        <dc:creator>TheDeadMedic</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Tue, 29 May 2018 22:02:32 GMT</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Is there a reason for the pairing of &lt;code&gt;public =&amp;gt; false&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;rewrite =&amp;gt; true&lt;/code&gt; for default custom post type arguments? If there isn't can we change the default &lt;code&gt;rewrite&lt;/code&gt; to inherit &lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt; at runtime?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I often see a large rewrite rules array from plugin/theme private post types not declaring &lt;code&gt;rewrite =&amp;gt; false&lt;/code&gt; - if there's no need for them seems bit of a waste - a default WP install is 17 rules per post type, 17 possible unnecessary regex checks per-request. Usually it's two or three CPTs I see per site and they stack up quick.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I'm passing a query arg that exists on args in current url, but the value passed by parameter is different. What happens is that the value of query arg passed as tabname is overwritten by value into current url arg.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I suggest an optional parameter called $merge_args and default value as true, in this way, all necessary query args to build pagination links should be passed by add_args and nothing is overwrite.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;

Hi @allendav ,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thanks for explain that and sorry for my bad ticket.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Effectively it's a misunderstanding what is for this checkbox.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But that doesn't take away the fact that you need a checkbox for the consent of data storage on the site, before the user comment.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Best regard.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Patrice
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Replying to &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44268#comment:1" title="Comment 1"&gt;allendav&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is referring to the logged-out commentor prompt "Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment." and opt-in checkbox.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But, as I understand it, @patricedefago is questioning whether commenting itself, logged out or otherwise, should require explicit opt-in consent from EU based commentors BEFORE allowing the comment to be sent, which wasn't the original intention of the logged-out commentor-prompt (that prompt was to safeguard the user's privacy if, for example, they were using a public computer to comment.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It is worth noting that we have an open ticket for consent logging: &lt;a class="new ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44043" title="#44043: enhancement: Framework for logging/retrieving a users consent state (new)"&gt;#44043&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It is worth nothing that comments can be edited, and that as of 4.9.6 can be exported and anonymized on request.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
The checkbox on the comment template it's not GDPR compliant.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The act of submitting content implied informed consent (possible to edit this message)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It must be required
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It must be have a link to privacy policies (possible to edit this link)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It must be to store the consent
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It must be possible to change, export and delete this data
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Possible to edit this
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thanks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Best regards.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #44267 (Privacy Request List Table: A way to show the time of request when ...) created</title>
      
        <dc:creator>birgire</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Tue, 29 May 2018 18:41:09 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44267</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44267/1527619269530605</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
When the request is older than 24 hours, then we can't see time of the request. An example:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;May 18, 2018
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The related methods are:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;WP_Privacy_Requests_Table::get_timestamp_as_date()&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;WP_Privacy_Requests_Table::column_default()&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
For comparison, here's an example from the &lt;em&gt;posts&lt;/em&gt; list table in &lt;em&gt;list&lt;/em&gt; view:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;&amp;lt;abbr title="2018/05/14 8:41:52 am"&amp;gt;2018/05/14&amp;lt;/abbr&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
and in the &lt;em&gt;excerpt&lt;/em&gt; view:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;Published
&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
2018/05/14 8:41:52 am
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Here's an example from the &lt;em&gt;comments&lt;/em&gt; list table:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;2018/04/20 at 5:35 pm
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I'm not sure the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;abbr&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is suitable here, after reading:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/32892825/2078474"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://stackoverflow.com/a/32892825/2078474&lt;/a&gt;

Replying to &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44151#comment:5" title="Comment 5"&gt;robobot3000&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But under what circumstance did you see non numeric keys in the $response data array?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
@allendav : I was replicating the documented behaviour of &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.array-merge.php"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;array_merge&lt;/a&gt;. But it's possible for any plugin author to define the exported data with non-numeric keys, even though it doesn't affect the output.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think we should probably flag that as doingitwrong
&lt;/p&gt;

I worry about large attachments making the ZIPs ridiculous, so if we did something like this, let's consider having settings or at least filters controlling the maximum size attachment that can be added and also controlling the maximum size export ZIP we are willing to create.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I'm with @azaozz in that we need to identify the personal information that a pingback/trackback contains, and my best guess is just the URL could expose a person? i.e. if their domain name incorporates their name?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Not sure how to tie these into our automated data export/erasure logic though since we don't have an email to tie them to.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
An "archive" state could be used instead of deleting the request.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Right now the only way to delete a privacy request (e.g. ones created while doing periodic testing) is to use the bulk-delete flow. It could simplify things greatly to add a per-request-row Delete action below the email address.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
We reviewed and discussed this in today's multisite office-hours (see &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C03BVB47S/p1527609680000818"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C03BVB47S/p1527609680000818&lt;/a&gt; for the chat log). Here are the decisions made during the conversation:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multisite's &lt;code&gt;get_user_count()&lt;/code&gt; has historically contained the global user count already. While it's stored on every network, it is actually a global count. Let's make this function available for single site.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The function supports an optional &lt;code&gt;$network_id&lt;/code&gt; parameter. This was just recently introduced (by myself, and I regret it given these circumstances), and it doesn't affect the outcome of the function, so we can deprecate it again. This should no longer be considered a network-specific function.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On single-site, the &lt;code&gt;user_count&lt;/code&gt; should be stored as a regular option. When setting up multisite, it should be migrated to become a network setting.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;wp_is_large_user_count()&lt;/code&gt; should be introduced as a globally available function to check the user count. It should call &lt;code&gt;get_user_count()&lt;/code&gt; to get its value and use 10000 as a maximum border by default. A filter should be present to modify the result of this function.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The multisite function &lt;code&gt;wp_is_large_network()&lt;/code&gt; should be updated to call &lt;code&gt;wp_is_large_user_count()&lt;/code&gt; if called with 'users' as the metric parameter. It won't have any functional change, just get rid of some logic that would otherwise be duplicated.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;wp_is_large_user_count()&lt;/code&gt; should be used in &lt;code&gt;count_users()&lt;/code&gt; to short-circuit as needed.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;del&gt;Given PHPs type coercion, this really could just &lt;code&gt;return $parent_file;&lt;/code&gt; without any check for empty, the caller should be responsible for checking for empty().&lt;/del&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Returning $parent_file could have unintended side-effects. The check for empty on $parent_file effects a global variable and does not necessarily have any correlation to the return statement.
&lt;/p&gt;

Marking this as &lt;code&gt;5.0&lt;/code&gt;, but to prevent complicating backports this should be done when &lt;code&gt;5.0&lt;/code&gt; is confirmed as the next release.

Idea: instead of a dropdown, perhaps the no-confirmation flow could be started with a link next to the "primary" confirmation-flow button
&lt;/p&gt;

I also think we should also consider giving a box for the admin to give a reason for skipping confirmation - that will be useful in the logs eventually
&lt;/p&gt;

I like it. If we do this, the patch should also add something like this to wordpress' wp_add_privacy_policy_content call:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
“If you request a reset of your password, your IP address will be included in an email to the site administrator."
&lt;/p&gt;

The solution will need to take into account mu-plugins / plugins that are used on all the sites vs plugins that are installed on individual sites.  The exporters and erasers can vary from site to site.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
There can be challenges using two or more forms, each with a different nonce, on the same page, when the nonce is added to the url as a GET parameter.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If ticket &lt;a class="new ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/43912" title="#43912: enhancement: Requests (new, pending, completed) should not be deletable. (new)"&gt;#43912&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/43912"&gt;Requests (new, pending, completed) should not be deletable&lt;/a&gt;) is the way to go, then this problem goes away :)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ps: For non-javascript support, the core uses the &lt;code&gt;message&lt;/code&gt; GET parameter, to be able to display the corresponding notice after the redirection. We can see this when a tag is deleted on the &lt;code&gt;edit-tags.php&lt;/code&gt; screen when javascript is disabled. For example:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;/wp-admin/edit-tags.php?taxonomy=category&amp;amp;message=2
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
that displays the &lt;em&gt;Category deleted&lt;/em&gt; message.
&lt;/p&gt;

Thanks @desrosj, I do like that idea of the global dismissable notice about the privacy policy being unpublished I think that'll help admins.

&lt;p&gt;
having the ticket here will help with awareness.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Right. The &lt;code&gt;wp-config.php&lt;/code&gt; file should be one level up, in the WP checkout dir, the parent directory of &lt;code&gt;/src&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/build&lt;/code&gt;. It may need to be moved there after running the install.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The only thing we can possibly do to help from core would be to check the location of &lt;code&gt;wp-config-sample.php&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;wp-config-tests-sample.php&lt;/code&gt; and create &lt;code&gt;wp-config.php&lt;/code&gt; next to them. (That looks like a pretty simple patch imho).
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>wontfix: &lt;p&gt;
I am also opposed to deleting any data automatically. I like @iandunn's suggestion for some sort of user flagging as inactive or abandoned, but for now this seems like plugin material. See the &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C9695RJBW/p1527608281000091"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;Slack discussion in the most recent Privacy component bug scrub&lt;/a&gt;.

I recommend a hook to disable that phone home - if an admin wants to privacy harden that far, that hook would support that.

&lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/commit/924bc264ff83662343a6eeb980b75a13c60d6c15"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;Poor VVV planning&lt;/a&gt; on my part when &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/08/06/a-new-frontier-for-core-development/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;core moved to the develop.svn workflow &lt;/a&gt;. :)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;code&gt;wp-config-sample.php&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;wp-config-tests-sample.php&lt;/code&gt; files are already in the correct location (project root). VVV (and others') installations via WP-CLI can be adjusted to match. The make/core &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/tutorials/installing-wordpress-locally/from-svn/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;installing from svn&lt;/a&gt; docs already do a pretty good job of referencing it in its correct location.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don't think there's anything we need to do in core for this one, though having the ticket here will help with awareness.
&lt;/p&gt;

I agree that this does not seem like a good use of the Customizer right now. Marking &lt;code&gt;maybelater&lt;/code&gt; as some new functionality &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; make this useful in the future.

This looks good and is working for me!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'd like to also add a filter to the subject in this email for parity while we are at it. One already exists for the email sent to a user to confirm the action (&lt;code&gt;user_request_action_email_subject&lt;/code&gt;), and I just created &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44265" title="#44265: defect (bug): Add filter for email subject for erasure complete notification (closed: fixed)"&gt;#44265&lt;/a&gt; for the erasure complete email.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
The subject of the email sent to a user informing them that their erasure request has been completed should be filterable.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;user_request_action_email_subject&lt;/code&gt; exists for the email received to confirm a privacy request, and &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44099" title="#44099: defect (bug): Add Request Type into Admin Email Subject for GDPR (closed: fixed)"&gt;#44099&lt;/a&gt; will add a filter for the email that informs the site admin a request has been confirmed.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Sometimes export and erasure can take a while, e.g. more than 15 seconds even, on slow hosts or when there is a lot to export.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It would be helpful to somehow indicate to the user how export is proceeding. Since the javascript knows what exporter index it is on, we could at least include that as a percentage or something.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Every time I run &lt;code&gt;grunt build&lt;/code&gt; locally, I am presented with an install screen when running WordPress from the &lt;code&gt;build&lt;/code&gt; directory.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Before &lt;a class="changeset" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/43309" title="Once upon a midnight dreary, while I coded, weak and weary,
In many a ..."&gt;r43309&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;wp-config.php&lt;/code&gt; file was created in the &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; directory. When &lt;code&gt;grunt build&lt;/code&gt; runs, it removes everything in the &lt;code&gt;build&lt;/code&gt; directory and copies everything in the &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; directory into &lt;code&gt;build&lt;/code&gt;. But now that you can't run WordPress from the &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; directory, the &lt;code&gt;wp-config.php&lt;/code&gt; file is never created in &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; to be copied to `build.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>invalid: &lt;p&gt;
I tested in a fresh WordPress 4.7.2 install with no additional plugin activated. The issue could not be reproduced. I believe it was some plugins I installed which caused the issue. Closing as invalid.

        <dc:creator>subrataemfluence</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Tue, 29 May 2018 14:06:16 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44261</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44261/1527602776337849</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Use of media URLs rather than the media files in original in Exported User Data zip file is probably to keep the file small in size so that it could be transferred quickly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;But what if admin or any user with the same level of privilege can delete one of more media files of the user requesting a personal data export accidentally after the Export is initiated and is emailed / downloaded.
&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Do we already have a guard or option to deal with such a situation? Is this possible to include the physical media files in the zip or at least create a separate area where these files would be backed up and reference URLs point to this location?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We can warn user (in the same email with the download link) to download the file say within next 72 hours otherwise the download link would expire. In the background after the stipulated time period the backup would be erased automatically. A new request needs to be initiated if this happens.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This will make sure that the server space is not being overused for a longer period of time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
How far you see the possibility of accidental deletion and user ends up with broken media link(s)? Do you think this could be a probable solution to avoid such a situation?
&lt;/p&gt;

Is that planned or purely conceptual? Honestly, I think its an imminent need.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I haven't worked on that particular idea, but I'm guessing it's still in the early stages. Everything starts out that way, though, it just needs people working on it to advance it. It'd be great to get your input on &lt;a class="new ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44043" title="#44043: enhancement: Framework for logging/retrieving a users consent state (new)"&gt;#44043&lt;/a&gt; to help move it forward.

Hi @tjholcomb1225,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thanks for the ticket, and welcome to Trac!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I just tried to reproduce this on my iPhone 7 Plus and was unable to replicate what you described above. I tried in Safari and Chrome.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I am going to close this out in favor of the thread you created in the support forums, as that is a better forum for this request unless we identify a way to reproduce this issue.
&lt;/p&gt;

Good catch! It could be

&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;post_name__in (array) – use post slugs. Specify posts to retrieve. (Available since version 4.4)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That's fine with me.  Altho, to be consistent with other version mentions, "Available" should be "available".

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Since updating to 4.9.6 I can no longer edit posts on my mobile devices (iPad Air, iPhone 7). Once I have interacted with the text in the edit field I can no longer scroll up or down on the screen. Consequently, if I highlight text at the end of my post, I cannot scroll back up to make format changes, or click the Update button, etc.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Tried dumping cache, no luck. Tried deactivating plugins, no luck.

      <description>&lt;i&gt;Type&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Milestone&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I think this makes sense. I like including the status in parenthesis next to the page in the dropdown.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I am thinking a bit more about the second part, though. I think that a standard admin notice when editing the Privacy Policy page may be sufficient. We could consider a dismissible notice everywhere in the admin for users that are allowed to edit the Privacy Policy informing them the site's privacy policy is unpublished as well.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;i&gt;Keywords&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
A new hourly cron was added that cleans up export files 3 days after their creation (see &lt;a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/4.9.6/src/wp-includes/functions.php#L5990"&gt;`wp-includes/functions.php`&lt;/a&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There is currently no way to delete an export file from the admin. When a request is deleted, the file remains in case the user has received an email with a link to their data export file.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
@joehoyle can you confirm that this works for the S3 plugin?
&lt;/p&gt;

The &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/classes/wp_query/#post-page-parameters"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;Post &amp;amp; Page Parameters&lt;/a&gt; section of the code ref page for &lt;code&gt;WP_Query&lt;/code&gt; contains the following incorrect text:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;post_name__in (array) – use post slugs. Specify posts to retrieve. (Will be available in version 4.4)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The "Will be available in..." text should be removed since 4.4 was released long ago.

If you look closely the original IP address is actually updated. Rather than removing the IP address completely the objective is to partially anonymize by reducing it to the corresponding network ID.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;Source: /wp-includes/functions.php
Line number: 6182
// Partially anonymize the IP by reducing it to the corresponding network ID.
if ( function_exists( 'inet_pton' ) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; function_exists( 'inet_ntop' ) ) {
   ...
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
For example, if the actual IP address was &lt;code&gt;127.0.0.1&lt;/code&gt; the new anonymized IP address would be &lt;code&gt;127.0.0.0&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As @rafsuntaskin mentions, it just keeps the network ID which will never let you know the real IP address from where the comment was originally made.
&lt;/p&gt;

One more thing I have noticed. May be this is done to comply with GDPR regulations. That is, in users' list the email addresses are no longer appearing for each user, although I am logged in as the admin. Just wanted to know if this is the case.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Please ignore this. I forgot to check the &lt;code&gt;Screen Options&lt;/code&gt;! :P

Why only copy the twenty 12/13/14 themes? What about twenty 15/16/17 themes?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
ooops, I didn't realize I had omitted those, will add.

I am not sure if it is done on purpose but I have noticed an inconsistency in selecting contents for &lt;code&gt;Erase Personal Data&lt;/code&gt; tool compared to &lt;code&gt;Export Personal Data&lt;/code&gt; tool.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I have made a few comments as well as uploaded some images through Media Library.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My account display name is Subrata Sarkar and the email address is gdpr-tester@…
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I created an Export Request for gdpr-tester@… and downloaded the &lt;code&gt;.zip&lt;/code&gt; file. I see both comments and media files are considered in index.html as a part of Personal Data.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the contrary, Erase Personal Data for the same email address does not consider Media Files. In Media Library the images uploaded by me are still showing uploaded by Subrata Sarkar!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Comment author is updated to &lt;code&gt;Anonymous&lt;/code&gt; though.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Am missing something?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One more thing I have noticed. May be this is done to comply with GDPR regulations. That is, in users' list the email addresses are no longer appearing for each user, although I am logged in as the admin. Just wanted to know if this is the case.

Hi,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It seems you have a setting somewhere that is hiding the checkbox text, but otherwise it's there as intended.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The fine volunteers over on our &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://wordpress.org/support"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;support forums&lt;/a&gt; can probably help you troubleshoot that part of it though.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'm closing this ticket for now, as I'm not seeing any obvious issue with WordPress core it self.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
IP addresses are partially anonymized intentionally keeping the network ID only. So, you don't know the real IP of the user but you still might have an idea of the region of the user.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Looks like Facebook is inserting a very long URL in the website URL field from the comment form - a URL which is visible by clicking the "change" link in "You are commenting using your Facebook account. ( Log Out /  Change )"
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The length of that URL must vary by FB account, because I'm getting one of 195 characters when testing, while another user got one over 200 when trying to comment on my wordpress.com-hosted blog, triggering the error message.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I propose you raise the length limit to fix this problem.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Should the clean task also clean the upgrade and uploads folders?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yes, good point, I will add that.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I like the VCS change to only copy the root .git/.svn folders
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yea, the original line:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;'!**/.{svn,git}/**'&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
attempts to exclude any &lt;code&gt;.svn&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;.git&lt;/code&gt; files from copying. The problem here is the &lt;strong&gt; prefix which causes the copy process to attempt to traverse every possible prefix path (eg every folder) which leads to the hung process.
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In my testing at least on my local system these folders are ignored by default (in which case we could remove the line). It is possible that on other systems/setups that is not the case, I'm going to see if I can figure out where/why this line was added.
&lt;/p&gt;

It is possible this is also an issue for the themes folder for some developers.
&lt;/p&gt;

Q: should we add similar explicit paths for theme copies/removal?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yes please, themes using SASS, PostCSS etc for theme dev along with Grunt or Gulp would be quite common practice
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I like the VCS change to only copy the &lt;em&gt;root&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;.git&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;.svn&lt;/code&gt; folders
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Should the &lt;code&gt;clean&lt;/code&gt; task also clean the &lt;code&gt;upgrade&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;uploads&lt;/code&gt; folders?
&lt;/p&gt;

I like this approach, thanks @adamsilverstein!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think we should be similarly explicit with themes, too.
&lt;/p&gt;

cc: @johnbillion with this patch, you should be able to leave plugins in the build folder - does this fix the issues you were experiencing? What do you think of the approach? any other ideas for how to resolve this?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;limit copy to exclude plugins and wildcard prefixes
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;exclude plugins folder when cleaning, add a clean:plugins task that does clear plugins
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Q: should we add similar explicit paths for theme copies/removal?

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
For local development, I've typically symlinked plugins I am working on into the &lt;code&gt;src/wp-content/plugins&lt;/code&gt; folder. These plugins sometimes include a large number of files (typically in a &lt;code&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt; folder) that causes the copy part of the core build process to hang or fail. Since &lt;a class="changeset" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/43309" title="Once upon a midnight dreary, while I coded, weak and weary,
In many a ..."&gt;r43309&lt;/a&gt; which requires a build step for core JavaScript and working out of the &lt;code&gt;build&lt;/code&gt; folder, I am having trouble getting the process to complete. I've seen several mentions of this issue in core slack. It is possible this is also an issue for the themes folder for some developers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In addition, since the build process wipes out the &lt;code&gt;build&lt;/code&gt; folder with each build, I can't put my plugins folder in &lt;code&gt;build&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One possible solution: exclude the plugins folder when wiping &lt;code&gt;build&lt;/code&gt; and skip copying any non-core plugins during the copy phase. If we get more explicit about what we delete and copy, developers can have more flexibility in their local setups.
&lt;/p&gt;
