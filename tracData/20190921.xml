&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ways to fix this without replacing Gravatar with another user avatar system:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cache the Gravatar response and serve the images from the local server.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This won't solve or prevent anything. You can still scrape WordPress sites and get the Gravatar ID.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It does solve the issue of site visitors being (potentially) tracked by Automattic. It's a different issue than the identity leakage, but a privacy issue nonetheless.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This also improves performance (at least on HTTP/2), because no other connection needs to be opened.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But this won't solve the privacy problem.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
By itself, of course not. That's why I said multiple steps were needed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The public URLs of the cached images should use a more secure algorithm than MD5 (like SHA256) and a site-specific salt.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In spirit you are correct but the suggestion is not. SHA is designed to be fast. You want a slow algorithm. One that is adaptive to boot (which is to say, tunable so that you can make it arbitrarily slow by changing a parameter). So what you really want is something more like bcrypt or whatever else is used for password hashing nowadays. As to a site-wide salt, you're much better off with a per user per site salt.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You are right these measures would make brute-forcing the email address from the public hash more difficult. Using &lt;code&gt;bcrypt()&lt;/code&gt; might be feasible for this specific application (and please note that &lt;code&gt;sha256()&lt;/code&gt; was only an example). I see some real-world impediments to implementing per-user salts (mainly related to the number of DB requests necessary for commenting on high-traffic sites), but that suggestion can certainly be explored.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For the note, I checked the plugin that got linked, and the only conclusion I picked up from scanning through the core file was that it was doing (bad) security through obscurity. sha256 with a salt-wide salt is *not* adequate.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'm not sure how you arrive at "security through obscurity". It prevents privacy leakage that is ridiculously easy to exploit on a large-scale basis across the whole internet. Is it providing perfect security (or treating the email address like a password)? No, but that was never the point. (And, since it is open source, you are welcome to &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/mundschenk-at/avatar-privacy"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;provide a pull request&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Also, you don't even need to brute force the thing. If users consistently fill in their image then an image search will let you track them down on every site they're using irrespective of the hashing method used by site A or B.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sure. But that is their choice (as opposed to the current WordPress Core implementation which leaks everyones MD5 hash, even for people who do not use Gravatar at all.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Doing this will leave only the lesser issue of always disclosing the hashed email address to Gravatar.com, possibly without their consent (especially if they don't even have a Gravatar account). Fixing this as well requires the addition of a checkbox, and an alternate way to create non-static default avatars. (Not technically hard, because all the dynamic default images available in Gravatar were once standalone WordPress plugins.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There remains the issue of Gravatar being used wholesale in forum software, gmail plugins, and what have you. The truth of the matter is that it's used everywhere, and not necessarily in a WP context. So fixing this in WP only is merely applying a bandaid.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
True, but WordPress is a big chunk of the web and applying "a bandaid" here removes those sites from the equation, which is still much better than doing nothing at al.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The actual issue, and the only sensible fix, is that the Gravatar ID generation code should be changed on the Gravatar website. Anything short of that and you'll still end up with opportunities to track users online. You can obfuscate things with some salting or some algorithm change but you cannot prevent it. And as already noted, even with perfectly adequate hashing on Gravatar's end, Google image search can potentially spoil the party.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For those people who choose to use Gravatars, yes. But the issue described in this ticket affects a lot more people than those. That's why I disagree that we should all wait for Automattic/Gravatar to change their API (which obviously will not happen).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Or then, change nothing (?) on Gravatar's end (it's a dumb cache at the end of the day) and advertise a new ID generation method for others to use on client websites. But keep in mind that WP is only dominant in the blog/CMS space. Change will be very slow.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Which gets me back to the point I made in my prior comment: changing this 10 years ago might have been an option. Trying to change it today is probably beating a dead horse. If Gravatar changes its ID generation code then you'll have swaths of non-WP websites and applications that will break overnight.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #48100 (the quotes around those two constants are missing causing PHP error) updated</title>
      
        <dc:creator>ayeshrajans</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Sat, 21 Sep 2019 20:33:23 GMT</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Hello @feminatzi - Welcome to WordPress Trac!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In PHP, an unquoted string like the ones you have in the ticket description are interpreted as PHP constants (&lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.constants.syntax.php"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.constants.syntax.php&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If the constants are not prior declared, you will indeed see errors.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In a healthy site, these two constants would be declared before any user code is executed, so no errors are shown. The unquoted code in fact is the correct one; I think you have a theme or a plugin that races this declaration. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Gravatar's API, yes. But that does not mean that WordPress' use of that API needs to continue in the current form. I've outlined what needs to be done in &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/14682#comment:52" title="Comment 52"&gt;comment 52&lt;/a&gt; and there's a plugin-based implementation available in the form of &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/avatar-privacy/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;Avatar Privacy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the meantime, I checked gravatar.com privacy policy. By clicking on it I am redirected to &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://automattic.com/privacy/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://automattic.com/privacy/&lt;/a&gt; and I want to crystallize here what the policy summary says:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Your privacy is critically important to us. At Automattic, we have a few fundamental principles:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;  We are thoughtful about the personal information we ask you to provide and the personal information that we collect about you through the operation of our services.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;  We store personal information for only as long as we have a reason to keep it.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;  We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what information on your website is shared publicly (or kept private), indexed by search engines, and permanently deleted.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;  We help protect you from overreaching government demands for your personal information.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;  We aim for full transparency on how we gather, use, and share your personal information.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This would be a lot less funny if the API hadn't been used for political purposes already. :D&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://politics.stackexchange.com/q/41160/15531"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://politics.stackexchange.com/q/41160/15531&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On a more practical note, IMHO this ship has probably sailed for better or worse. If memory serves me well (this ticket is a decade old) there was chatter at one point that basically broke down to the notion that an email was no private so get over it, or something to that effect (which I disagreed and still disagree with, but that was the party line). Also, changing the API isn't trivial given the ecosystem that now depends on Gravatars in their current format. Which is to say, at this point this ticket is probably beating a dead horse.&lt;br /&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Ok, so for now, the best course of action is to get a confirmed list of required and recommended list of extensions needed. I also like the descriptions in this patch: &lt;a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/23912/23912.6.patch"&gt;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/23912/23912.6.patch&lt;/a&gt;, this could be used (with appropriate props ofc) for the suggested extensions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And the handbook (&lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://make.wordpress.org/hosting/handbook/handbook/server-environment/#php-extensions"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://make.wordpress.org/hosting/handbook/handbook/server-environment/#php-extensions&lt;/a&gt;) should be updated as well? &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This was done in &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10336" title="#10336: defect (bug): Inline CSS filter for kses (closed: fixed)"&gt;#10336&lt;/a&gt; back in the days of the browser wars, CSS hacks, and IE6 support. @azaozz do you remember the nastiness you were trying to avoid?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That was ...ten years ago! As far as I remember it was a security fix/hardening at the time. The code came from (then separate) WP Multisite.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At the time there were quite a few possibilities for misuse, different for the different browsers and browser versions. Many of these "CSS features" have been removed since then, but some may still be aground.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If we want to remove the restriction seems we will need to add a lot more granular filtering for inline &lt;code&gt;style&lt;/code&gt; attributes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I've started drafting a dev-note for WP 5.3 covering this ticket and I'm wondering how much detail the dev note should contain ?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Should it contain the details about the method signature changes (old vs new) for each adjusted method or should it, for instance, just contain a link to the relevant commit ? or even just a link to this ticket ?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; list all the methods changed in the dev-note either way.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Thanks for the report @mikaumoto and thanks for the patch @munyagu.&lt;br /&gt;

That patch looks good but this could do with some unit tests.&lt;br /&gt;

Hi @johnbillion &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I have fixed the issue. Can you please review? I am new to core contribution, so please do let me know if something is missing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We don't need to update the &lt;code&gt;Tests_Get_Comment_Count()&lt;/code&gt; class as by updating the &lt;code&gt;get_comment_count&lt;/code&gt; function's return value will resolve that.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;

So, despite that DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR PHP constant is correct if Windows OS environment (for i.e. XAMPP), and is &lt;code&gt;\&lt;/code&gt;, WordPress returns paths url-like - &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
So we have to run a replacements in our UI_Routing class to have a correct paths, despite the fact that Windows recognizes both, the paths are looking strange when they have some chars forward-slashed, and some - back-slashed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$currentThemePath&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;str_replace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'/'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'\\'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;get_stylesheet_directory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;

The patch still applies cleanly on trunk.&lt;br /&gt;
Tested again and the patch looks ready for &lt;code&gt;commit&lt;/code&gt; in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;

      <title>Ticket #48098 (ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined even if it is enqueued ...) updated</title>
      
        <dc:creator>KestutisIT</dc:creator>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
It is registered via plugin's &lt;code&gt;registerScripts&lt;/code&gt; methods in AssetLoader, and it registers the script 'init' and enqueues after 'add_shortcode' call. The enqueuing on 'add_shortcode' is important, because the we save network resources, and plugin scripts are not loaded on the page where the is no plugin shortcode used:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;MainController&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// &amp;lt;...&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;add_action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'init'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'runOnInit'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// &amp;lt;...&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;runOnInit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//&amp;lt;..&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Register front-end scripts
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$objAssetController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;registerScripts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I also did another experiment:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I tested with 'TwentySixteen' theme - it works as expected.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I tested with 'TwentyNineteen' theme - it works unexpectecly.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Appears that TwentySixteen was using jQuery in theme for keyboard navigation or so, so it was not raising issues for the plugin, as jQuery got in the header.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We need to solve this somehow, and force and say by out plugin that it must be loaded in header.&lt;br /&gt;
And expected behavior is that if I run 'enqueue_script' either WordPress should give me a warning that the given script is NOT (yet) registered, or enqueue it. While now it does not gives me any warning but &lt;strong&gt;acts unexpectedly&lt;/strong&gt;. This confuses me as a developer of the purpose of &lt;strong&gt;enqueue_script&lt;/strong&gt; as it does not look reliable then with code.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The full source code of &lt;code&gt;MainController&lt;/code&gt; is in GitHub, if you want to take a deeper look:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/SolidMVC/Deals/blob/master/Controllers/MainController.php"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://github.com/SolidMVC/Deals/blob/master/Controllers/MainController.php&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
(and on W.org SVN as well of the plugin as &lt;code&gt;/deals/&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So I have a template in a plugin with:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Scripts
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;wp_enqueue_script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'jquery'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;?&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;
&amp;lt;div class="great-plugin-wrapper"&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;!--- BUNCH OF HTML --&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;script type="text/javascript"&amp;gt;
jQuery(document).ready(function() {
    jQuery('.responsive-deals-slider').slick({
    // Bunch of javascript
    });
});
&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thanks for the report! When exactly this code runs?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If it's not hooked to the &lt;code&gt;wp_enqueue_scripts&lt;/code&gt; action as &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_enqueue_script/#more-information"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;recommended in the documentation&lt;/a&gt;, then it's too late for jQuery to be printed in &lt;code&gt;wp_head()&lt;/code&gt;, so it's only printed in &lt;code&gt;wp_footer()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And I'm getting 'ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined' error in console even if it is enqueued in HTML before using.&lt;br /&gt;
In source code it says jQuery is loaded late in footer&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Note that &lt;code&gt;wp_enqueue_script( 'jquery' )&lt;/code&gt; does not print the script right away, it only enqueues the script to be printed later by &lt;code&gt;wp_print_head_scripts()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;wp_print_footer_scripts()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Does something changed in WordPress in recent months regarding this, and why so? It was working at least 6 months ago.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As far as I know, nothing has changed in the script loader in the last few years in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

@SergeyBiryukov &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yes, but this is a mistake because the gmdate() PHP function not considered WordPress gmt_offset Option.hense the correct time of registration is not entered into the database. If you see other functions such as wp_insert_post function &lt;a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/5.2.3/src/wp-includes/post.php?marks=3541#L3541"&gt;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/5.2.3/src/wp-includes/post.php?marks=3541#L3541&lt;/a&gt; .The post_date that entered into the database exactly on the local WordPress Time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Status summary:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Issues in WP Core native code have been fixed.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Issues in the external &lt;code&gt;Requests&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;SimplePie&lt;/code&gt; libraries remain unpatched at this moment.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Regarding &lt;code&gt;SimplePie&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ticket &lt;a class="assigned ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/36669" title="#36669: defect (bug): Update SimplePie to Latest Version and possibly include PHP-MF2 (assigned)"&gt;#36669&lt;/a&gt; is open to address this, but has just been punted to &lt;code&gt;Future Release&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The issue has been patched upstream, but is not contained in a tagged release yet.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If SimplePie does not get updated to a more recent version in WP 5.3, the existing code should be patched for the time being. I will attach a patch for this.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Regarding &lt;code&gt;Requests&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The issue has been patched upstream (above mentioned PR has been merged in the mean time), but is not contained in a tagged release yet.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Still hoping for a new tagged release over the next few days to go into WP 5.3.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

Summary of current status of this ticket:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Everything has been addressed, safe for the PHPMailer issues.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;PHPMailer has been updated to v 5.2.27 in &lt;a class="changeset" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/46097" title="Mail: Update PHPMailer to 5.2.27.
The full list of changes is ..."&gt;[46097]&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40472" title="#40472: defect (bug): Update PHPMailer to 5.2.27 (closed: fixed)"&gt;#40472&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class="reopened ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/41750" title="#41750: enhancement: Update PHPMailer to 6.0 (reopened)"&gt;#41750&lt;/a&gt; is milestoned for WP 5.3. If it lands in time, that should solve the remaining issue. If not, the PHPmailer patch in this ticket may need a refresh and should probably be applied.&lt;br /&gt;

@Clorith  my thought was that if the log is not in the normal flow of the WordPress structure then the notification should be less severe. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If the log isn’t in the normal WordPress flow it would be much more difficult to randomly find it. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Hi @mehrshaddarzi, welcome to WordPress Trac! Thanks for the patch.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Looking at the &lt;a class="source" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/5.2.3/src/wp-includes/user.php?marks=1767,1768#L1751"&gt;documentation for wp_pre_insert_user_data filter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/export/HEAD/tags/5.2.3/src/wp-includes/user.php#L1751" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;user_registered&lt;/code&gt; parameter is intentionally a UTC timestamp, not a local time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Could you describe the problem the patch solves?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Hi there, thanks for the report! I'm sorry it took so long for someone to get back to you.&lt;br /&gt;

        <dc:creator>SergeyBiryukov</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Sat, 21 Sep 2019 13:23:00 GMT</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;i&gt;Keywords&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Severity&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Replying to &lt;a class="reopened ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/48098" title="#48098: defect (bug): ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined even if it is enqueued ... (reopened)"&gt;KestutisIT&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So I have a template in a plugin with:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Scripts
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;wp_enqueue_script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'jquery'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;?&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;
&amp;lt;div class="great-plugin-wrapper"&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;!--- BUNCH OF HTML --&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;script type="text/javascript"&amp;gt;
jQuery(document).ready(function() {
    jQuery('.responsive-deals-slider').slick({
    // Bunch of javascript
    });
});
&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thanks for the report! When exactly this code runs?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If it's not hooked to the &lt;code&gt;wp_enqueue_scripts&lt;/code&gt; action as &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_enqueue_script/#more-information"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;recommended in the documentation&lt;/a&gt;, then it's too late for jQuery to be printed in &lt;code&gt;wp_head()&lt;/code&gt;, so it's only printed in &lt;code&gt;wp_footer()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And I'm getting 'ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined' error in console even if it is enqueued in HTML before using.&lt;br /&gt;
In source code it says jQuery is loaded late in footer&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Note that &lt;code&gt;wp_enqueue_script( 'jquery' )&lt;/code&gt; does not print the script right away, it only enqueues the script to be printed later by &lt;code&gt;wp_print_head_scripts()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;wp_print_footer_scripts()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Does something changed in WordPress in recent months regarding this, and why so? It was working at least 6 months ago.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As far as I know, nothing has changed in the script loader in the last few years in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Great points @jrf, I wasn't aware we were moving forward with the JSON removal yet.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Well, it may still be reverted for WP 5.3 until a way to block updates for WP majors based on the extensions has been put in place, but having &lt;code&gt;json&lt;/code&gt; set as a required extension will allow us to move forward with it in the (near) future.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I've taken those into account in 47454.2.patch​&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;

      <description>&lt;i&gt;Focuses&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Milestone&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I agree with the above. Removing pointer cursors from clickable non-link elements seems to go against the spirit of the guideline, even if it adheres to its exact wording.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As noted above, the more fundamental fix is to ensure that links and buttons are correctly used depending on the action being performed, rather than removing the cursor pointer from non-links.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Great points @jrf, I wasn't aware we were moving forward with the JSON removal yet.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I've taken those into account in &lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/47454/47454.2.patch" title="Attachment '47454.2.patch' in Ticket #47454"&gt;47454.2.patch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/47454/47454.2.patch" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
There's no way to reliably know if a path is accessible to others in any way, so I stand by my previous opinion that if logging is enabled, it should alert the user, they are the only ones that can know if it's available or not.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

@Clorith With an eye on &lt;a class="reviewing ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/47699" title="#47699: task (blessed): Remove redundant JSON polyfills for PHP native functionality (reviewing)"&gt;#47699&lt;/a&gt;, shouldn't &lt;code&gt;json&lt;/code&gt; be &lt;code&gt;required =&amp;gt; true&lt;/code&gt; ?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Also: the &lt;code&gt;function&lt;/code&gt; check should be on the &lt;code&gt;json_last_error&lt;/code&gt; function as WP polyfilled all the other functions, including &lt;code&gt;json_encode()&lt;/code&gt;, which means the &lt;code&gt;function_exists()&lt;/code&gt; won't work as intended when used with &lt;code&gt;json_encode()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;

I've had a chance to look at this today and I think there were some misunderstandings going on, which I believe I found the root of.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/47869/47869.2.patch" title="Attachment '47869.2.patch' in Ticket #47869"&gt;47869.2.patch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/47869/47869.2.patch" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt; removes the check for the constants &lt;code&gt;DISALLOW_FILE_MODS&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;AUTOMATIC_UPDATES_DISABLED&lt;/code&gt;, as they're both covered by the new &lt;code&gt;WP_Site_Health_Auto_Updates::test_wp_automatic_updates_is_disabled&lt;/code&gt; checker (which looks up both of those in one go), and should reduce the false positive possibilities here.&lt;br /&gt;

@SergeyBiryukov This is a very small change which doesn't change functionality at all, just improves performance. Think it can still go into WP 5.3 ?&lt;br /&gt;

      <description>&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Also, I'll exclude the lock update, but I'm unsure if this will cause any failures because composer validate complains about them not being up to date with the changes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think you do need to include an updated &lt;code&gt;composer.lock&lt;/code&gt; with this change. Just run &lt;code&gt;composer update --lock&lt;/code&gt; to only update the hash and not update dependencies.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So I should just put those libraries to ext- and use wildcard, or remove them entirely (they seem to be required)? Not sure if there will be any negative impact for that.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yes. If they are extensions which are part of the PHP core which cannot be disabled and PHP cannot be explicitly compiled without them, leaving them out is fine.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Note: I have not checked the extensions listed. It looks very long to me - definitely compared to what's in Site Health.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

This ticket still needs some work and testing.  With Beta 1 of version 5.3 only a few days away, this is being moved to &lt;code&gt;Future Release&lt;/code&gt;.  If this ticket can be resolved in time for 5.3, feel free to re-milestone.&lt;br /&gt;

Hey @itowhid06, thank you for the patch! &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you have looked to see that sometimes array is passed to this did you consider if it would be more useful to use &lt;code&gt;string|array&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;mixed&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

This would be awesome. I think adding the PHP version would be highly valuable here as well.&lt;br /&gt;

      <title>Ticket #48098 (ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined even if it is enqueued ...) created</title>
      
        <dc:creator>KestutisIT</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Sat, 21 Sep 2019 12:07:34 GMT</pubDate>

      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/48098/1569067654493898</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
So I have a template in a plugin with:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Scripts
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;wp_enqueue_script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'jquery'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;?&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;
&amp;lt;div class="great-plugin-wrapper"&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;!--- BUNCH OF HTML --&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;script type="text/javascript"&amp;gt;
jQuery(document).ready(function() {
    jQuery('.responsive-deals-slider').slick({
    // Bunch of javascript
    });
});
&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
And I'm getting 'ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined' error in console even if it is enqueued in HTML before using.&lt;br /&gt;
In source code it says jQuery is loaded late in footer:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;&amp;lt;script type='text/javascript' src='http://localhost/GitHub/web1/sub1/wp-includes/js/jquery/jquery.js?ver=1.12.4-wp'&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
. Why? Does something changed in WordPress in recent months regarding this, and why so? It was working at least 6 months ago.&lt;br /&gt;
And how to make sure jQuery is not loaded in the footer, or that&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt; jQuery(document).ready( &lt;/code&gt; would work?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'm using:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Twenty Nineteen theme
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multisite
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Guttenberg
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Newest WordPress
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Plugin's shortcode
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just one plugin and one theme.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
The WordPress local date [get_option( 'gmt_offset' ) * HOUR_IN_SECONDS] is not specified in the WordPress &lt;code&gt;wp_insert_user&lt;/code&gt; function in &lt;code&gt;user_registered&lt;/code&gt; parameter.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The wp-includes/user.php in Line 1724 is :&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;$user_registered = empty( $userdata['user_registered'] ) ? gmdate( 'Y-m-d H:i:s' ) : $userdata['user_registered'];
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
change to :&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;$user_registered = empty( $userdata['user_registered'] ) ? current_time( 'mysql' ) : $userdata['user_registered'];

      <description>&lt;i&gt;Keywords&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/47454/47454.patch" title="Attachment '47454.patch' in Ticket #47454"&gt;47454.patch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/47454/47454.patch" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt; updates the tests to reflect the current state of the Hosting Teams handbook recommendations.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This includes removing the &lt;code&gt;bcmath&lt;/code&gt; function, and introduce some new ones used by core in various locations for certain scenarios.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It also extends the test feature to be more flexible, now also allowing for inclusion of constant and class names to be checked for. This also provides a more robust test platform, as certain attributes may exist, while others are not available, most notably the &lt;code&gt;libsodium&lt;/code&gt; check which now looks for the &lt;code&gt;SODIUM_LIBRARY_VERSION&lt;/code&gt; constant, instead of the &lt;code&gt;sodium_compare&lt;/code&gt; function as the function check was unreliable for that.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Thanks for a great review @afercia &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Within attachTabsPanelListeners the variable selectAll is undefined: it needs to be declared at the top of the function. Please run grunt jshint to lint the JS files&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thanks for the headup. Usually phpcs and jshint are part of my workflow, but sometimes things slip by :-)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While it is a partially pre-existing thing, could anyone please refresh my mind about the usage of removeAttr( 'checked' ) vs. prop( 'checked', false ) and prop( 'checked', true )? Genuinely asking.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Good question. According to:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/3.0/#breaking-change-removeattr-no-longer-sets-properties-to-false"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/3.0/#breaking-change-removeattr-no-longer-sets-properties-to-false&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Breaking change: .removeAttr() no longer sets properties to false&lt;br /&gt;
Prior to jQuery 3.0, using .removeAttr() on a boolean attribute such as checked, selected, or readonly would also set the corresponding named property to false. This behavior was required for ancient versions of Internet Explorer but is not correct for modern browsers because the attribute represents the initial value and the property represents the current (dynamic) value.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It is almost always a mistake to use .removeAttr( "checked" ) on a DOM element. The only time it might be useful is if the DOM is later going to be serialized back to an HTML string. In all other cases, .prop( "checked", false ) should be used instead.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/47048/47048-6.diff" title="Attachment '47048-6.diff' in Ticket #47048"&gt;47048-6.diff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/47048/47048-6.diff" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt; replaces the &lt;code&gt;.removeAttr( "checked" )&lt;/code&gt; instances with &lt;code&gt;.prop( "checked", false ) &lt;/code&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'd rename data-area to something along the lines of "data-items-type" or something like that to better clarify what it is.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Done.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Originally, the various "Select all" were links. It's a pattern that was commonly used in WordPress for no-js compatibility. Progressive enhancement: the basic functionality was available also whit JS off (see it was using a &amp;amp;selectall=1 param). Now that the "Select All" are checkboxes and their functionality is based on JavaScript, when JS support is off they're hidden with the CSS class hide-if-no-js. Personally I don't have objections to make this feature only available when JS is on but I guess the logic to check for $_REQUEST&lt;a class="missing wiki"&gt;selectall?&lt;/a&gt; that's still in place should be removed?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/47048/47048-6.diff" title="Attachment '47048-6.diff' in Ticket #47048"&gt;47048-6.diff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/47048/47048-6.diff" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt; replaces that logic regarding &lt;code&gt;$_REQUEST['selectall']&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;i&gt;Keywords&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Version&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/48090/48090.patch" title="Attachment '48090.patch' in Ticket #48090"&gt;48090.patch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/48090/48090.patch" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt; expands the email sent with the most commonly asked questions when something crashes, namely the WordPress version, what theme is being used, and the version of the plugin that caused an issue (if caused by a plugin).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
These are all created as an associated array, which is filterable through &lt;code&gt;recovery_email_debug_info&lt;/code&gt;, making it possible to add more details in some scenarios.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The information sent is intentionally constricted on our end, to avoid information overload and confusion for the end user.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The patch also moves the code for fetching plugin details out of the &lt;code&gt;get_cause()&lt;/code&gt; function to a separate &lt;code&gt;get_plugin()&lt;/code&gt; call so that it can be reused more easily when building the error email.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #46303 (Update wp_privacy_send_personal_data_export_email to provide the same ...) updated</title>
      
        <dc:creator>birgire</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Sat, 21 Sep 2019 10:04:13 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/46303#comment:16</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/46303#comment:16/1569060253090258</guid>
      <description>&lt;i&gt;Keywords&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I tested this successfully with a request from &lt;code&gt;user1@example.com&lt;/code&gt; and then with a plugin:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;&amp;lt;?php
Plugin Name: Test 46303
add_filter( 'wp_privacy_personal_data_email_to', function($user_email) {
	return 'user2@example.com';
} );
add_filter( 'wp_privacy_personal_data_email_subject',function($subject ) {
	return 'Test';
} );
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Steps to test:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A request is made for &lt;code&gt;user1@example.com&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A verification link is sent to &lt;code&gt;user1@example.com&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;user1&lt;/code&gt; clicks on verification link in email.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Admin sends the export link (clicks the button).
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The export download link is sent to &lt;code&gt;user2@example.com&lt;/code&gt; emailbox and not &lt;code&gt;user1@example.com&lt;/code&gt; emailbox as expected.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The privacy test group runs successfully.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;One should though use the email filter with great care, to avoid sending the data export link to wrong emails!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
ps:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Just a minor regarding PHPdoc, maybe we should replace:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;* @since 5.3.0 Introduced the $email_data array.
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
with&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt; * @since 5.3.0 Introduced the `$email_data` array.
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
for the changelog display on &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It took me few seconds though to notice in the test filter, that &lt;code&gt;$site_url&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code&gt;$email_data&lt;/code&gt; are not value generated within the string as it's single quote but not double quote :-)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #48093 (get_comment_count() should return an integer for all counts of all statuses) created</title>
      
        <dc:creator>johnbillion</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Sat, 21 Sep 2019 09:55:12 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/48093</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/48093/1569059712221058</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;get_comment_count()&lt;/code&gt; returns a mixture of integers and numeric strings depending on the comment status and count.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Any status with zero comments is represented by integer 0.&lt;br /&gt;
Any status with more than zero comments is represented by a numeric string.&lt;br /&gt;
The &lt;code&gt;total_comments&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;all&lt;/code&gt; elements are always integers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Example:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;array(7) {
  ["approved"]            =&amp;gt; string(1) "221"
  ["awaiting_moderation"] =&amp;gt; int(0)
  ["spam"]                =&amp;gt; string(1) "10"
  ["trash"]               =&amp;gt; int(0)
  ["post-trashed"]        =&amp;gt; int(0)
  ["total_comments"]      =&amp;gt; int(221)
  ["all"]                 =&amp;gt; int(211)
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It should return integers for all statuses for consistency.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The tests in &lt;code&gt;Tests_Get_Comment_Count()&lt;/code&gt; should be switched to using &lt;code&gt;assertSame()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
When you add content before the shortcode the shortcode content is fixed but the body content is still wrong in its location &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
if you add a special html character then it still is wrong as the special character is splitted and the body content is still at the wrong location. It should be behind the shortcode.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://cl.ly/6884788e631a"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://cl.ly/6884788e631a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a style="padding:0; border:none" href="https://cl.ly/6884788e631a"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cl.ly/6884788e631a" alt="https://cl.ly/6884788e631a" crossorigin="anonymous" title="https://cl.ly/6884788e631a" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
very weird behaviour of the editor in rtl mode.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Replying to &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/14682#comment:49" title="Comment 49"&gt;chrisherbert&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I wanted to bring attention to another project that I've created to illustrate the potential privacy risks of Gravatars, especially in concert with the REST API: &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://dontreadthecomments.org"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://dontreadthecomments.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The site lets you search for for comments that are associated with an email across several thousand WordPress and WordPress.com sites.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thanks Chris, I am interested in talking to you offline about this. I will be in touch.&lt;br /&gt;

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
IIRC adding the lib-... requirements is only useful when you actually add versions to them. Otherwise, set the ext-... with * instead (for those extensions which are not part of the PHP core).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So I should just put those libraries to &lt;code&gt;ext-&lt;/code&gt; and use wildcard, or remove them entirely (they seem to be required)? Not sure if there will be any negative impact for that.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Also, I'll exclude the lock update, but I'm unsure if this will cause any failures because &lt;code&gt;composer validate&lt;/code&gt; complains about them not being up to date with the changes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Hi&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
i have a found a serious issue in the wp editor using shortcodes. The content of the page and the shortcode switches.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
look at the explaining image&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a style="padding:0; border:none" href="https://cl.ly/841c884024d8"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cl.ly/841c884024d8" alt="https://cl.ly/841c884024d8" crossorigin="anonymous" title="https://cl.ly/841c884024d8" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://cl.ly/841c884024d8"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://cl.ly/841c884024d8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
i tested this with a default wp install running 20-19 theme and only the rtl tester plugin active to test rtl mode.&lt;br /&gt;

Heads up, I've updated node to v10.16.3.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

No feedback on this one. Should we commit the current patch so the core widget will be ok or punt it to 5.4 to work on custom widgets as well. I'm all in favor to commit it as it. Any thoughts on that @pento @westonruter ?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

I tested &lt;code&gt;34904.11.diff&lt;/code&gt; and the patch is looking fine to me as it.&lt;br /&gt;
I'd say go for a +1 to commit it and to iterate during 5.3's beta cycle.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'm going to write a dev-note about those changes once it get committed.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No support for properties supporting &lt;code&gt;\&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;grid&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;grid-column&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;grid-row&lt;/code&gt;. They're long hand only for now.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unit tests for various flex and grid properties
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Extended list of supported column layout properties on previous patch
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Removed &lt;code&gt;clip-path&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;shape-outside&lt;/code&gt; because I am undecided as to whether they're safe
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ignored the brackets problem

@johnbillion @netweb patch refreshed. Hoping this can still get in 5.3&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thanks @welcher, your patch is a little off, it has a couple of of changes relating to WPCS, you've changed it from 2.1.0 to 2.0.0, and added it as a script, I suspect this is because of recent commits, would you mind refreshing &lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/46815/46815.3.diff" title="Attachment '46815.3.diff' in Ticket #46815"&gt;46815.3.diff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/46815/46815.3.diff" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt; please.&lt;br /&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Flex and columns support are good to go. Grid I am in two minds about.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Attachment with tests incoming.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;grid&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;grid-row&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;grid-column&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;grid-template-*&lt;/code&gt; each accept brackets, eg &lt;code&gt;repeat( 6, 1fr )&lt;/code&gt; which are blocked in KSES. &lt;code&gt;grid&lt;/code&gt; additionally accepts &lt;code&gt;\&lt;/code&gt; which KSES doesn't like in CSS either.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This was done in &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10336" title="#10336: defect (bug): Inline CSS filter for kses (closed: fixed)"&gt;#10336&lt;/a&gt; back in the days of the browser wars, CSS hacks, and IE6 support. @azaozz do you remember the nastiness you were trying to avoid?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
None of the characters &lt;code&gt;\()&lt;/code&gt; are required for CSS Grid but rather nice to haves. As a result I am not sure if this is good to go with documentation informing users that some grid attributes have limited support or whether it is better to hold off until the next release:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;repeat( 6, 1fr )&lt;/code&gt; can be worked around
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;minmax( 1fr, 700px )&lt;/code&gt; less so
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
As the block editor already uses &lt;code&gt;grid-template-columns&lt;/code&gt;, I'm leaning towards merge and document.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #37703 (Optimise `wp_delete_comment` as called from `wp_delete_post`) updated</title>
      
        <dc:creator>peterwilsoncc</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Sat, 21 Sep 2019 01:40:56 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/37703#comment:7</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/37703#comment:7/1569030056020420</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
@Mjte90 Please accept my apologies for not seeing your follow up question so long ago.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Step 1: Optimise call within &lt;code&gt;wp_delete_post()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;sort &lt;code&gt;$comment_ids&lt;/code&gt; from highest to lowest &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/blob/0bd3d78db1e54e9ba221322ec8fe8feec6f692ff/src/wp-includes/post.php#L2988-L2990"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;before deleting each comment in this loop&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;this allows the &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/blob/0bd3d78db1e54e9ba221322ec8fe8feec6f692ff/src/wp-includes/comment.php#L1386-L1389"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;reparenting step&lt;/a&gt; to be skipped when deleting each comment.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Step 2: Accept array of comments when calling &lt;code&gt;wp_delete_comment()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;when deleting an array of comments, calculate reparenting in bulk.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;if a comment's parent is to be deleted, reparent to the first ancestor not being deleted
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The SQL queries may become something like this:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;-- Comment threads
-- 1 -&amp;gt; 3 -&amp;gt; 5, 6 -&amp;gt; 11
-- 2 -&amp;gt; 7 -&amp;gt; 9
-- 8 -&amp;gt; 4 -&amp;gt; 10
-- 12 -&amp;gt; 13 -&amp;gt; 14
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;-- wp_delete_comment( [ 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13 ] );
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;-- Determine if a parent comment is being deleted from a comment that is not being deleted
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; comment_ID&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; comment_parent
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; wp_comments
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;WHERE&lt;/span&gt; comment_parent &lt;span class="k"&gt;IN&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt; comment_ID &lt;span class="k"&gt;NOT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;IN&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;-- result: (4, 8), (9, 7), (14, 13)
-- Comments 8, 7, 13 are being deleted and parents of comments 4, 9, 14.
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;-- Determine parents of 8, 7, 13 to determining grandparents of 4, 9, 14
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; comment_ID&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; comment_parent &lt;span class="k"&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; wp_comments &lt;span class="k"&gt;WHERE&lt;/span&gt; comment_ID &lt;span class="k"&gt;IN&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;-- result (8, 0), (7, 2), (13, 12)
-- No parent comment 8 thus no grandparent for comment 4. Comment 4 should be reparented to 0
-- Parent of comment 7 is 2, thus comment 7 should be reparented to 2
-- Parent of comment 13 is 12 (grandparent comment 14), 12 will be deleted.
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;-- Repeat above step for comment 12 to determine comment 14's closest ancestor
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; comment_ID&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; comment_parent &lt;span class="k"&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; wp_comments &lt;span class="k"&gt;WHERE&lt;/span&gt; comment_ID &lt;span class="k"&gt;IN&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;-- result: (12, 0)
-- 12 has no parent comment, thus comment 14 should be reparented to 0
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;-- No further looping required to determine reparenting
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;-- Reparent as follows
-- Comment 4, reparent to 0
-- Comment 7, reparent to 3
-- Comment 14, reparent to 0
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Step 2 is the more difficult step, as it requires fired hooks to remain unchanged.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
This patch has changed the test to a loose type comparison of the &lt;code&gt;$result&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;$expected&lt;/code&gt; which will allow for type juggling and  basically means the method is not actually being tested correctly anymore. I'll upload a patch shortly to fix this.&lt;br /&gt;

Hi @ayeshrajans Yet another good idea ;-)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Reviewed &amp;amp; the changes themselves look ok, the patch just needs one space on the inside of the parentheses on both changed lines.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$size&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1024&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$size&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;KB_IN_BYTES&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$log&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$power&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Also saw you opened the PR to SimplePie 👍🏻. &lt;br /&gt;
Adding the link here for reference: &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/simplepie/simplepie/pull/622"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://github.com/simplepie/simplepie/pull/622&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Hi @dingo_d Yet another great step towards the future!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I've reviewed your patch and have two remarks:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Please undo the update to the &lt;code&gt;PHP_CodeSniffer&lt;/code&gt; package in the &lt;code&gt;composer.lock&lt;/code&gt; file. There is an issue with a particular sniff which is why this update hadn't been done yet - see &lt;a class="assigned ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/47632" title="#47632: task (blessed): Coding Standards fixes for WP 5.3 (assigned)"&gt;#47632&lt;/a&gt; for more details.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;IIRC adding the &lt;code&gt;lib-...&lt;/code&gt; requirements is only useful when you actually add versions to them. Otherwise, set the &lt;code&gt;ext-...&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; instead (for those extensions which are not part of the PHP core).
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</description>

      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/47131#comment:20/1569027005814655</guid>
      <description>&lt;i&gt;Keywords&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Just reporting that my testing confirms that the patch still fixes the issue and that also the &lt;code&gt;dashboard.js&lt;/code&gt; instances of sortable are respecting the width condition of the newly introduced &lt;code&gt;maybeDisableSortables&lt;/code&gt; function and do not allow movement when in the one column width less than 782.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For visibility, here is the logic that controls if sortable is applied based on width and column prefs &amp;amp;&amp;amp; number of boxes: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;			if (
				( width &amp;lt;= 782 ) ||
				( 1 &amp;gt;= $sortables.find( 'h2:visible' ).length &amp;amp;&amp;amp; jQuery( '.columns-prefs-1 input' ).prop( 'checked' ) )
			) {
				this.disableSortables();
			} else {
				this.enableSortables();
			}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I have one more instance to verify in &lt;code&gt;postbox.js&lt;/code&gt; Will hopefully have some good news soon, but this is looking super close to being ready for a final review.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I very much support @joostdevalk's suggestion.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While it may be a lot in one patch, it does make sense to me to make these changes all in one go as they all touch the same lines of code.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The sniff I previously mentioned which is in the &lt;code&gt;WordPress-Extra&lt;/code&gt; ruleset also checks for use of unconditional &lt;code&gt;include[_once]&lt;/code&gt; use.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To run it over WP Core while respecting the existing exclusions for the files coming from dependencies, follow the below steps:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add a new file to the root of your clone of WP Core (directory above &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt;) called &lt;code&gt;phpcs.xml&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add the following contents to that file:
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;&amp;lt;?xml version="1.0"?&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ruleset name="WP Core local"&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;rule ref="./phpcs.xml.dist"/&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;rule ref="PEAR.Files.IncludingFile.BracketsNotRequired"&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;type&amp;gt;warning&amp;lt;/type&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;/rule&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;rule ref="PEAR.Files.IncludingFile.UseRequire"&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;type&amp;gt;warning&amp;lt;/type&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;/rule&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;rule ref="PEAR.Files.IncludingFile.UseRequireOnce"&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;type&amp;gt;warning&amp;lt;/type&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;/rule&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ruleset&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Note: the file should automatically be git-ignored/svn-ignored.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start="3"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Run PHPCS with the below command to just and only see the errors coming from this sniff:
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;vendor/bin/phpcs --sniffs=PEAR.Files.IncludingFile

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
While working on &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/48075" title="#48075: task (blessed): Remove conditional use of PHP realpath() (closed: fixed)"&gt;#48075&lt;/a&gt; / looking for code which can be removed now support for PHP &amp;lt; 5.6.20 has been dropped, I came across three instances where checks were done for the existance of the &lt;code&gt;stream_get_contents()&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;function_exists&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'stream_get_contents'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Code.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Now, there are only two reasons I can think for this code to exist:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Support for PHP &amp;lt; 5.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.stream-get-contents.php"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;`stream_get_contents()` function&lt;/a&gt; was introduced in PHP 5.0.0. It might be that this code is from before that time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start="2"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hosts disabling the function using the &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.disable-functions"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;`disabled_functions` ini directive&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I honestly don't know if that's a thing, but that's the only other reason I could think of for this code to exist.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Based on the comment found in the &lt;a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/src/wp-admin/includes/class-wp-filesystem-ssh2.php#L29"&gt;`class-wp-filesystem-ssh2.php`&lt;/a&gt; documentation, I strongly believe the reason is &lt;strong&gt;1)&lt;/strong&gt; and that the removal of these conditions is long overdue, if for no other reason than that the function is used unconditionally in the &lt;a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/src/wp-includes/pomo/mo.php#L76"&gt;`mo.php`&lt;/a&gt; file.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So based on that I am attaching a patch to &lt;em&gt;remove&lt;/em&gt; the condition.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

This ticket needs a decision and a patch.  With Beta 1 of version 5.3 only a few days away, this is being moved to &lt;code&gt;Future Release&lt;/code&gt;.  If this ticket can be resolved in time for 5.3, feel free to re-milestone.&lt;br /&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Errors are terrible, if you're not familiar with troubleshooting, they're even worse.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What happens if you get the dreaded email from WordPress, your site has crashed, you know something broke, but are lost beyond that, so you go to seek help in fixing it. Unfortunately you can't help others, help you. They asked you something simple; what version of the Plugin X are you using? You have no idea, you feel lost, those helping you feel frustration, it's bad times all around.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But wait, there, in the distance, a shimmering light!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When an error email is sent, let's include a new section, prefix it with &lt;code&gt;When seeking help with this issue, you may be asked for some of the following information&lt;/code&gt;, and then add the current WP version, the plugin version of that which broke, what theme is in use would also be handy, this is all information we can readily grab and provide after all!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Right before the &lt;code&gt;DISABLE_WP_CRON&lt;/code&gt; definition, explanation given refers to the site as a "blog".  This should probably be updated to "site".&lt;br /&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I wanted to bring attention to another project that I've created to illustrate the potential privacy risks of Gravatars, especially in concert with the REST API: &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://dontreadthecomments.org"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://dontreadthecomments.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The site lets you search for for comments that are associated with an email across several thousand WordPress and WordPress.com sites.&lt;br /&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I have just come across this. I am appalled that some WP devs consider this an a non-issue. Unfortunately this may be the case in some regions / jurisdictions but it is certainly &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; the case in others. For example in the European Union a recent privacy directive states :&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
"Organizations in breach of GDPR can be fined up to 4% of annual global turnover or €20 Million (whichever is greater). This is the maximum fine that can be imposed for the most serious infringements e.g.not having sufficient customer consent to process data or violating the core of Privacy by Design concepts."&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is a feature provided by core and &lt;em&gt;it is clearly flawed&lt;/em&gt;, fullstop.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So far I have been considering WP for some projects but this is not a point in its favor. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Site owners/admins can't be burdened with liabilities such as this. That some WP devs show a cavalier attitude towards privacy is simply not good enough in 2019.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This needs to be fixed, and fast.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

I have not been able to dig into this during this release cycle. I'm also thinking that if this is changed, it should happen &lt;code&gt;early&lt;/code&gt; just in case this creates any unforeseen problems.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Removing myself so someone else can dig into this if they'd like in the mean time.&lt;br /&gt;

While this shouldn't be a problem for the vast majority of sites, not having JSON compiled into PHP will cause things to break in wonderful ways. See &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/18015" title="#18015: defect (bug): Restore compat Services_JSON (class-json.php), json_encode, json_decode (closed: fixed)"&gt;#18015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think a check in the core upgrader for json functions and a rollback if they are not available could be a warranted addition. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Our situation is even worse. We have a privacy policy page that &lt;strong&gt;even the site's Administrator cannot edit&lt;/strong&gt;. Only the Super Administrator of the whole multisite network can edit it. Seems that whatever was intended as a "conscious" decision was a poor choice (i.e. a mistake), and furthermore, that some bug in the way it is implemented is causing issues even beyond what was "intended."&lt;br /&gt;

      <description>&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That said, this ticket is interesting in that the W3C guideline goes against what many users anticipate: if something is clickable, they expect to see a pointer icon when hovering over it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I agree with Kjell — as a user, I expect that any interactive element will use the "pointer" cursor. Interactivity on the web has changed a lot in the past decade, and people have been using pointers on anything that looks like a button for so long (maybe because we started styling link tags like button once CSS was mainstreamed, I don't know) that the original intent has been superseded the learned behavior of "pointer = I can click this." &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since the argument is around using consistent and relevant cursors as to benefit users with cognitive disabilities, I'd actually argue that WordPress dropping the pointer from buttons actually goes against the intent of the spec, because we'd be using buttons inconsistently from much of the web. Having a pointer also makes it more clear when a button is &lt;em&gt;disabled&lt;/em&gt;, because disabled buttons shouldn't have the pointer cursor. I think this is a case where a browser default hasn't caught up with modern web practices.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Because the minimum version of PHP required by WordPress is now 5.6.20 (see &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/46594" title="#46594: task (blessed): Bump PHP version requirements (closed: fixed)"&gt;#46594&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="changeset" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/45058" title="PHP: Finish updating PHP Minimum version

&lt;p&gt;
Sure. The only visible change is to remove the second (Learn more) link as it points to the same location and that is not accepted for accessibility. Otherwise it follows the original design.&lt;br /&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I think the labels in the first mockup seem like the clearest path forward, but I agree that we historically don't have visible labels in some of those areas. For instance, we don't currently include filter labels or "Currently x items selected" labels in other areas of WP-Admin: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a style="padding:0; border:none" href="https://cldup.com/FOho-Gqat--2000x2000.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cldup.com/FOho-Gqat--2000x2000.png" alt="https://cldup.com/FOho-Gqat--2000x2000.png" crossorigin="anonymous" title="https://cldup.com/FOho-Gqat--2000x2000.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Should those areas include visible labels too?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Regarding the "Menu" label at the left: I wonder if there's a more descriptive title there. "Menu" seems a little superfluous. Perhaps something like "Actions" or "Media Actions"?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/45954/45954.diff" title="Attachment '45954.diff' in Ticket #45954"&gt;45954.diff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/45954/45954.diff" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt; has a few changes:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coding standards fixes.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Removes &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt; for the exit call (there should be a separate ticket to remove all of these since it is a language construct and does not require them)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I also looked at how the other list tables handle these requests. Between &lt;code&gt;edit.php&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;users.php&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;edit-comments.php&lt;/code&gt;, there are some inconsistencies.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some use &lt;code&gt;$_GET&lt;/code&gt;, some use $_REQUEST` for the conditional.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some use &lt;code&gt;$_REQUEST&lt;/code&gt; some use &lt;code&gt;$_SERVER&lt;/code&gt; for building the redirect URL.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Both use &lt;code&gt;wp_redirect()&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;wp_safe_redirect()&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I've updated the patch to be more consistent with these, even though there are some differences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #39340 (Scheduled Posts are being missed (problem with wp-cron.php?)) updated</title>
      
        <dc:creator>archon810</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Fri, 20 Sep 2019 18:33:12 GMT</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
WP's problem with posting scheduled posts reliably, even if they're slightly late - better a bit late than never or really late - has been plaguing it for years. It's time to resolve it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Numerous solutions have been created, but they're all bloated or use up too many resources (such as checking on every page load):&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/sLaNGjI/wp-missed-schedule"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://github.com/sLaNGjI/wp-missed-schedule&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/scheduled-post-trigger/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://wordpress.org/plugins/scheduled-post-trigger/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/switch-logic-to-wp-cron/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://wordpress.org/support/topic/switch-logic-to-wp-cron/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
etc.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Can WP just sort this out so it's not a problem almost every day?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>wontfix: &lt;p&gt;
I propose that we close this issue as &lt;code&gt;wontfix&lt;/code&gt; because we've considered it for four years and have been unable to come up with a solution. in all likelihood my patch will never be modified to replace other EXIF tags and this is likely just incidental to one behavior on the Olympus cameras that won't be a running issue into the future.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If we &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; want to fix this then I propose we create a new ticket that hard-codes the Olympus behavior and makes for a tiny simple patch, even if it leaves such a tombstone of hard-coded exception in the image handling code forever.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
@vparkhere and others, do we feel like this continues to be problematic enough that it warrants the fix?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
@tpnotes one thing that can be overlooked here is that while certain professional and enthusiast photographers will be choosing their data intentionally (though who would actually name their file &lt;code&gt;OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA&lt;/code&gt; - I think that's a non-point) it's actually something people have been confused about and raised as an issue that unintentionally their photos got this strange name. in other words, the system seems to making it hard for people who are less aware to know "what she/he is uploading" and this patch is an attempt to address that failure.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

@jorgefilipecosta thanks for adding in the comments and updating the patch. I'm back and can readdress this ticket now.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'm nervous when I see us returning an empty string for invalid inputs. In the JavaScript side we already have the problem that if a block somehow fails during the parsing step it can mysteriously disappear. I'd rather return &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; or throw an exception so that the caller can have better signaling that something failed, so that a developer can quickly see if they made a typo or mistake in sending in their block. Silently hiding failures is something I've seen come back and bite us too often.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thoughts?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Also, what if we split out the type-checking into its own function. Seems like that might be usable in other places too.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If we like these ideas I can submit a new version of the patch soon.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
@afercia I volunteered to test this, but unfortunately I can't replicate the problem to know whether it would be fixed. The buttons were normal for me, even at a different zoom and at different browser widths.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Internet Explorer: version 11 (11.356.18362.0)&lt;br /&gt;
WordPress: both 5.2.3 and the very latest (using the Beta Tester plugin, not running a build version)&lt;br /&gt;
Classic Editor: 1.5&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hopefully someone else can test.&lt;br /&gt;

      <title>Ticket #34904 (The design of the focus outline on buttons/elements could be improved) updated</title>
      
        <dc:creator>kjellr</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Fri, 20 Sep 2019 18:08:46 GMT</pubDate>

      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/34904#comment:60/1569002926734977</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Uploaded a fresh version: &lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/34904/34904.11.diff" title="Attachment '34904.11.diff' in Ticket #34904"&gt;34904.11.diff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/34904/34904.11.diff" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This one makes sure the alternate color schemes follow these new button styles focus borders: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a style="padding:0; border:none" href="https://cldup.com/HRCTIWkq9U.gif"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cldup.com/HRCTIWkq9U.gif" alt="https://cldup.com/HRCTIWkq9U.gif" crossorigin="anonymous" title="https://cldup.com/HRCTIWkq9U.gif" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A note about that: Not all of the alternate button styles pass contrast tests. But they didn't before, so I think we're fine? Seems like a separate issue, and one that should be considered separately.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This also fixes an issue where the active toggle button wasn't very noticeable. Should be a bit better now: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a style="padding:0; border:none" href="https://cldup.com/V2FGDIE28i-1200x1200.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cldup.com/V2FGDIE28i-1200x1200.png" alt="https://cldup.com/V2FGDIE28i-1200x1200.png" crossorigin="anonymous" title="https://cldup.com/V2FGDIE28i-1200x1200.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This patch is getting pretty large, but I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; it covers everything it needs to. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;code&gt;buttons.css&lt;/code&gt; file header suggests to edit &lt;code&gt;editor.css&lt;/code&gt; as well. I see that file contains some TinyMCE buttons, but I can't find any of them in use, so I'm hesitant to make any changes. I checked the classic editor and it seems to be fine as is. If anyone knows where those are, and can fix them, that would be excellent. Otherwise, I think this is just ready for some solid, thorough testing. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That's probably my last patch in this thread for the day, so feel free to update and build on the patch if anyone finds bugs! Thanks. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Yes, it is a large change with many usability and back-compat considerations. Perhaps there is still time to do "something" here? Maybe can still add changing of the first/last name order by a translatable string. That'd need a patch but should be quite straightforward. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;i&gt;Keywords&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Can we add a few unit tests for a few of the new properties? Other than that, this is looking good.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
@peterwilsoncc are you able to see this one through or confirm it's ready?&lt;br /&gt;

Thanks for the patch! It would be helpful to describe what problem it solves though :)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Looking at other instances of &lt;code&gt;wp_safe_redirect()&lt;/code&gt; in the admin, it's only used in combination with &lt;code&gt;wp_get_referer()&lt;/code&gt; to validate the target location sent by the client's browser.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don't see a point in using it when the location is a known admin URL.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What's your reason for switching categories to non-hierarchical? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Because a category is part of the permalink structure and there shouldn't be any parent child relation in general.&lt;br /&gt;
So using this filter seemed to be the easiest option.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In Site Health &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; headings, only the first words are capitalized, which looks weird to me and doesn't seem to follow any existing pattern in core&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Just noticed that's actually also the case in "At a Glance" dashboard widget:&lt;br /&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Right now, even the mystery man is retrieved by querying gravatar.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We should have a local copy of the anonymous avatar that is served.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At the least, if there is no requirement for an email, which is what is used to provide the gravatar requests, why make requests to gravatar?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We could say caching gravatar responses is plugin territory, and while I would like to do with with gravatar for performance, this is about not making a call in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Looking at the history of this ticket, following the chronological order of events, it's clear it didn't receive much attention. It was punted several times &lt;em&gt;skipping at least 4 entire release cycles&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think I can answer this :)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This ticket is a minor enhancement that makes sense on some level but is also somewhat "questionable". It doesn't bring anything new, just repeats existing code/features and tries to make them a bit more convenient to use, but at the same time has some drawbacks.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Imho this is the reason it went through several iterations and is still not ready. It doesn't bring anything of significant value. Looking at the ticket itself:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In practical use, wp_get_attachment_image_src is very useful for displaying an attached image - but requires a separate call to get any other image meta or the alt attribute.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That's right. &lt;code&gt;wp_get_attachment_image_src()&lt;/code&gt; is a function to retrieve the &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; of an image. Nothing more. Similarly other attachment data can be retrieved by other functions. This works quite well.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Having a helper/convenience function to combine all of the attachment data that may be needed when outputting an &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;img&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag is not a bad idea, but it repeats existing functionality that already is straightforward and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As @joemcgill and I mention above the current implementation is "not there yet". It should probably be a refactoring of &lt;code&gt;wp_get_attachment_image()&lt;/code&gt;. The functionality proposed in this ticket seems to belong there. And yes, it may take a long time to come up with the right solution/code, especially when the proposed change is "on the fence" and doesn't bring new features or significant improvements.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There is also the chance that automatically adding &lt;code&gt;alt&lt;/code&gt; text that is stored in the DB to all &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;img&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags will introduce errors. Images can be used in different contexts, always having the same &lt;code&gt;alt&lt;/code&gt; regardless of context may be wrong in some cases. But that's for the accessibility team to decide, just trying to think what else may be needed in the implementation :)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Great catch, @afercia! I've uploaded a new patch (&lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/47140/47140.2.diff" title="Attachment '47140.2.diff' in Ticket #47140"&gt;47140.2.diff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/47140/47140.2.diff" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt;) that removes those styles. Could use one more test, but after that I think it's probably good to go. &lt;br /&gt;

      <title>Ticket #30155 (Fix crop image functionality within edit flow) updated</title>
      
        <dc:creator>adamsilverstein</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Fri, 20 Sep 2019 16:34:29 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30155#comment:47</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30155#comment:47/1568997269486139</guid>
      <description>&lt;i&gt;Milestone&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Punting this to 5.4 because we haven't had a chance to address this ticket and we are about to enter 5.3 beta.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Outstanding issues that should be resolved here:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
From &lt;a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30155#comment:37"&gt;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30155#comment:37&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Clicking the crop tool again crops the image to previously cropped dimensions, which does not feel correct.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And from &lt;a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30155#comment:38"&gt;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30155#comment:38&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
#### Remediation Guidance&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Firstly, it would be beneficial to low-vision users and users with&lt;br /&gt;
cognitive disabilities if the crop/aspect ratio and selection inputs&lt;br /&gt;
were closers to each other (both in layout, and in source order). It&lt;br /&gt;
would then be easier for such users to move between sections and adjust&lt;br /&gt;
the input values after making an initial imperfect selection. It would&lt;br /&gt;
also be more logical to place these fields after the image editing area,&lt;br /&gt;
rather than before it.&lt;br /&gt;
The cropping feature should function for any input mode, i.e. it should&lt;br /&gt;
work from only the keyboard, only the mouse, only touch, or any&lt;br /&gt;
combination of those.&lt;br /&gt;
For combined functions such as maintaining an aspect ratio while&lt;br /&gt;
resizing the crop region, have a separate checkbox which users can&lt;br /&gt;
select to maintain (or ignore) aspect ratio. The current Shift key&lt;br /&gt;
functionality can be retained, but only as a shortcut for users who can&lt;br /&gt;
use mouse and keyboard at the same time, it should not be the only way&lt;br /&gt;
of doing this.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Ticket #34904 (The design of the focus outline on buttons/elements could be improved) updated</title>

      <pubDate>Fri, 20 Sep 2019 16:25:10 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/34904#comment:59</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/34904#comment:59/1568996710025097</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Replying to &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/34904#comment:54" title="Comment 54"&gt;kjellr&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Also, some elements (like standard links) still have the "glow" effect on focus: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a style="padding:0; border:none" href="https://cldup.com/3jgdK8X9C2-3000x3000.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cldup.com/3jgdK8X9C2-3000x3000.png" alt="https://cldup.com/3jgdK8X9C2-3000x3000.png" crossorigin="anonymous" title="https://cldup.com/3jgdK8X9C2-3000x3000.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This ticket seems broad enough to refresh those too — should we replace those with the solid line used in Gutenberg?: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a style="padding:0; border:none" href="https://cldup.com/LJxz7pTk-A-2000x2000.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cldup.com/LJxz7pTk-A-2000x2000.png" alt="https://cldup.com/LJxz7pTk-A-2000x2000.png" crossorigin="anonymous" title="https://cldup.com/LJxz7pTk-A-2000x2000.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I've added &lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/34904/34904.10.diff" title="Attachment '34904.10.diff' in Ticket #34904"&gt;34904.10.diff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/34904/34904.10.diff" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt;, which removes that glow hover state wherever I could find it. After some sleuthing, I actually believe that solid color hover state in Gutenberg actually only applies to buttons, so I'm not even sure it's supposed to be applied to buttons that look like links in the first place. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Instead of adopting that, I've brought in the dotted line border that Gutenberg applies to most other focusable, non-button elements: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a style="padding:0; border:none" href="https://cldup.com/WOQlbXMM1M-3000x3000.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cldup.com/WOQlbXMM1M-3000x3000.png" alt="https://cldup.com/WOQlbXMM1M-3000x3000.png" crossorigin="anonymous" title="https://cldup.com/WOQlbXMM1M-3000x3000.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Happy to reassess that treatment if we decide, but I think it works pretty well, and helps align with what you'd usually see in Gutenberg. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'm going to dig into the alternate color scheme buttons next and make sure those work nicely.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;i&gt;Keywords&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Here's a patch that addresses the following:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;adds labels to the edit buttons
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;relocates the edit buttons group to the right sidebar, this was needed because the buttons with labels now take up more space and the previous position was not ideal for this.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;small style tweaks to the edit tools buttons to have them match the style of secondary buttons in other places
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;adds an H2 (Editing Tools) to the group of edit buttons for easier navigation and findability.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a style="padding:0; border:none" href="https://cldup.com/byOQw2ulw1.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cldup.com/byOQw2ulw1.png" alt="https://cldup.com/byOQw2ulw1.png" crossorigin="anonymous" title="https://cldup.com/byOQw2ulw1.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a style="padding:0; border:none" href="https://cldup.com/v65Qui0opg.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cldup.com/v65Qui0opg.png" alt="https://cldup.com/v65Qui0opg.png" crossorigin="anonymous" title="https://cldup.com/v65Qui0opg.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Regarding the discussion above about the redundancy between the Crop tool and the Image Crop section: this patch does not address that. I think it's out of scope for now and addressing that issue requires a more thorough assessment of the information architecture of this view.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #45928 (Twenty Nineteen: Add a filter to the $primary_color variable) updated</title>

      <description>&lt;i&gt;Keywords&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I have some questions on this. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If we are introducing functions to get the default hue, saturation, lightness, etc., is there a need for the filters being introduced in the &lt;code&gt;functions.php&lt;/code&gt; file? &lt;code&gt;$default_hue&lt;/code&gt; is being set by calling one of those &lt;code&gt;*_get_default_*&lt;/code&gt; functions, but the saturation, lightness, and lightness hover are not.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Any new filter being introduces should also be accompanied by &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/inline-documentation-standards/php/#4-hooks-actions-and-filters"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;a proper docblock&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;

      <description>&lt;i&gt;Keywords&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Just to make the status here clear, from @SergeyBiryukov in the last mention in Slack above:&lt;br /&gt;
"The patch deprecates &lt;code&gt;wp_get_attachment_thumb_file()&lt;/code&gt; and introduces a new function, though core still uses the old function in a few places. Needs some more work to replace all the instances."&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If this happens before the beta on Monday, it can still be committed.&lt;br /&gt;
Otherwise, it'll need to get moved from the 5.3 milestone.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #47767 (Simplify and backport the local environment) updated</title>
      
        <dc:creator>desrosj</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Fri, 20 Sep 2019 15:31:00 GMT</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Is there anyway to have a custom &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; file that takes precedence over the one included that can be ignored by version control?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Using &lt;code&gt;export/SET/Set-Item&lt;/code&gt; commands work, but it does not persist. Changing the &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; file works temporarily, but it's easy to revert those changes when refreshing your local environment. Lately I have been using &lt;code&gt;7.4-fpm&lt;/code&gt;, but forgetting to export that option before starting the environment has happened for me a lot.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Not sure if I missed this somewhere in this discussion or the Make/Core posts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

I think we should center the title regardless of the direction we take, but here are two ideas:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The title becomes the menu dropdown as well, since it's the same label as the selected menu item
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We update the menu title from "menu" to "media types" to be more explicit about what content you'll find inside the menu.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Hey @antpb we were just wondering whether you envisaged a particular solution when this was moved to 5.3. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you haven't envisaged a solution, I mentioned that we could look at taking what Drupal does with 'row heights'. It's a very primitive win to the problem, but it could be used as a step forward to a more beautiful solution. The 'row heights' functionality provides a numeric input field and changing the number (and submitting) changes the order of the field.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ideally we need to have an envisaged solution before going to design, otherwise we could see a lot of back and forth that we might not have time for in this 5.3 release.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Hey All, I might be missing a conversation in the ticket so apologies if this is already discussed.&lt;br /&gt;
I was wondering if we could add visible text to the button so that people using speech recognition software, people who say things like "Click show password button" can easily press it - otherwise they have to guess the label of the button.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If we moved the button outside of the input field, this would give the button more space for a visible label.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What are your thoughts?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Discussed during today's accessibility bug-scrub. This ticket is related to other tickets marked as "bug" aiming to improve contrast and focus indication. It's best to change it from "enhancement" to "bug" so that all these related tickets can be handled together.&lt;br /&gt;

Looks like the latest patch needs a refresh and this still needs unit tests.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With 5.3 Beta 1 in 3 days, I am going to punt this to 5.4. This should probably land early in the cycle to allow for some soak time and iteration.&lt;br /&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Looking through this patch I'm really liking where you're going with this. Some minor feedback: I see a lot of &lt;code&gt;include&lt;/code&gt; statements where I think we should be using &lt;code&gt;require_once&lt;/code&gt;. For instance includes on &lt;code&gt;admin-header.php&lt;/code&gt; don't make sense: without that the admin doesn't make any sense. Or an &lt;code&gt;include&lt;/code&gt; on &lt;code&gt;wp-load.php&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;xmlrpc.php&lt;/code&gt;, if that fails, there's no WP, a require would be much better...&lt;br /&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I worked on a few iterations. I do, however, have some reservations over labelling all 3 places. My reluctance is we aren't doing elsewhere in the interface so it does both create a large amount of cognitive load and inconsistency. Similarly, because the only style to reuse is uppercase, that creates comprehension issues for those for example with dyslexia. However, here is an example of 'all' labels - from a design perspective I would advise against this all on version:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a style="padding:0; border:none" href="http://cldup.com/lGlo2DbbP0.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://cldup.com/lGlo2DbbP0.png" alt="http://cldup.com/lGlo2DbbP0.png" crossorigin="anonymous" title="http://cldup.com/lGlo2DbbP0.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I have shortened to 'filter' as I am unsure this needs to explicitly say attachments due to location.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
An iteration that balances cognitive load, comprehension and accessibility hopefully is:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a style="padding:0; border:none" href="http://cldup.com/xfrMKEBYpS.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://cldup.com/xfrMKEBYpS.png" alt="http://cldup.com/xfrMKEBYpS.png" crossorigin="anonymous" title="http://cldup.com/xfrMKEBYpS.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Looking also at the other ticket seems that we need to do a new UI to manage better the categories in the bulk mode specifically on to remove the categories itself from the posts.&lt;br /&gt;
So probably is more on javascript side than in PHP and we need to investigate also what is the best place for that code.&lt;br /&gt;
Maybe we need to see also the bulk edit mode why is not generating rightly the UI, maybe is something that should be splitted in two parts and one involve also the Design team?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

        <dc:creator>afercia</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Fri, 20 Sep 2019 12:49:09 GMT</pubDate>

      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/48087/1568983749230493</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
In the media modal dialog &amp;gt; "Image Details" frame, the buttons group for the alignment setting is so shrinked that the buttons are barely usable. See attached screenshot.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At first glance, this appears to be a regression in trunk after the changes to all the media views form elements (and related CSS selectors adjustments) from &lt;a class="changeset" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/45499" title="Accessibility: Improve accessibility of all the media views form ..."&gt;[45499]&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/47122" title="#47122: defect (bug): Media views: fix unlabelled controls (closed: fixed)"&gt;#47122&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The fix appears simple, patch incoming.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Also to note: this seems to be the only reported breakage so far after the extensive changes in &lt;a class="changeset" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/45499" title="Accessibility: Improve accessibility of all the media views form ..."&gt;[45499]&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/47122" title="#47122: defect (bug): Media views: fix unlabelled controls (closed: fixed)"&gt;#47122&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Possible solution, interrupt the SQL relationship between post and category with scripts from phpmyadmin.&lt;br /&gt;
Of the type:&lt;br /&gt;
Suppose we have the table prefix wp_blog, launching the command "delete from wp_blog_term_relationships where term_taxonomy_id = 1 and object_id in (select id from wp_blog_posts where post_type = 'post' and post_status = 'publish');" we break the correlation between the two elements (post and uncategorized) this action has value only on the post set to "published".&lt;br /&gt;
We report the counter value of the uncategorized category.&lt;br /&gt;
From phpmyadmin:&lt;br /&gt;
"Update wp_blog_term_taxonomy set count = 0 where term_taxonomy_id = 1;"&lt;br /&gt;
Method to use with caution, risk damaging SQL database, make backups before any action.&lt;br /&gt;
Result: Removes "uncategorized from posts"&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

High Contrast Mode edge cases on WordPress trunk 5.3

      <title>Ticket #47117 (Media modals: Focus is invisible in Windows high contrast views) updated</title>
      
        <dc:creator>afercia</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Fri, 20 Sep 2019 12:39:25 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/47117#comment:11</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/47117#comment:11/1568983165291203</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I've just tested High Contrast Mode on Windows 10 – Internet Explorer 11. As expected, things have improved after WordPress 5.0, see &lt;a class="changeset" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/44544" title="Accessibility: Add focus styles for Windows High Contrast mode.
 ..."&gt;[44544]&lt;/a&gt; and the related ticket &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/41286" title="#41286: defect (bug): Focus style and High Contrast Mode (closed: fixed)"&gt;#41286&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Seems to me most of the focusable elements in the media modal dialog and Image Editor have now a good focus indication. More testing would be appreciated, of course.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'm attaching below a collage of screenshots to illustrate some edge cases (outlined in red) that need to be addressed. [Edit: the first image in the collage illustrates a case where focus indication is good]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of the remediation guidelines:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add a transparent (or visible) outline to elements which are using box-shadow to show focus.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For elements which are selected and focussed, selected elements should also have a border.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ensure the outline is not given a negative outline-offset, as this would place it directly on top of the border, making it visibly indistinguishable by users.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;
1 can be considered almost done: see the edge cases to address and see &lt;a class="new ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/45910" title="#45910: defect (bug): Improve and extend focus styles for Windows High Contrast mode (new)"&gt;#45910&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
2 and especially 3 need to be addressed across the whole admin. I'd recommend to start by removing the negative outline-offset from all the ruleset where the transparent outline for High Contrast Mode is used.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

so .. here is the fix. We need an extra unique (!) colum to sort by AFTER the comment count has been sorted. I used post_modified in this case.&lt;br /&gt;

      <title>Ticket #48086 (Add required extensions and libraries to composer.json) created</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Composer offers a way to require or suggest certain platform packages: &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md#platform-packages"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md#platform-packages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Ticket 48081 addresses the PHP version, and this one covers the required libraries and extensions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I've used the WP-CLI ext package (&lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/johnbillion/ext"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://github.com/johnbillion/ext&lt;/a&gt;) to generate all the required and suggested extensions and libraries.&lt;br /&gt;

Great, thanks for testing! We also need to make sure this works alright with alternate color schemes. If nobody else gets there first, I'll take a look later today. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Also, some elements (like standard links) still have the "glow" effect on focus: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a style="padding:0; border:none" href="https://cldup.com/3jgdK8X9C2-3000x3000.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cldup.com/3jgdK8X9C2-3000x3000.png" alt="https://cldup.com/3jgdK8X9C2-3000x3000.png" crossorigin="anonymous" title="https://cldup.com/3jgdK8X9C2-3000x3000.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This ticket seems broad enough to refresh those too — should we replace those with the solid line used in Gutenberg?: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Thanks for the context @afercia. I have tested and got it working now, super weird but glad it's working after a fresh svn up, I had done grunt build so assume caught a bad build. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For those following along what I see now is:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a style="padding:0; border:none" href="http://cldup.com/JQdRv8xEHm.png"&gt;&lt;img width="50%" alt="http://cldup.com/JQdRv8xEHm.png" title="http://cldup.com/JQdRv8xEHm.png" crossorigin="anonymous" src="http://cldup.com/JQdRv8xEHm.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Based on that I have a few iterations, I am not sure the side menu one is ideal from usability or a11y but adding incase. For me having menu on a new line does help some visual issues.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a style="padding:0; border:none" href="http://cldup.com/3Ipo1AYLNS.png"&gt;&lt;img width="50%" alt="http://cldup.com/3Ipo1AYLNS.png" title="http://cldup.com/3Ipo1AYLNS.png" crossorigin="anonymous" src="http://cldup.com/3Ipo1AYLNS.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a style="padding:0; border:none" href="http://cldup.com/kpNB3s7LlZ.png"&gt;&lt;img width="50%" alt="http://cldup.com/kpNB3s7LlZ.png" title="http://cldup.com/kpNB3s7LlZ.png" crossorigin="anonymous" src="http://cldup.com/kpNB3s7LlZ.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
cc @melchoyce for a second design input here. Likely we do need styling for this but for now focusing on placing as styling can happen after beta 1.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Patch looks good.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A new test is needed which:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Registers a post type and calls &lt;code&gt;current_user_can( $post_type_obj-&amp;gt;cap-&amp;gt;delete_posts )&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Asserts the return value is correct
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Without the patch in place, the test should fail due to the PHP notice being triggered
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
OK, reproduced this .. it has to do with the fact that te results are ordered by a column that has the very same information. Thus is *might* be possible that de database engine spits the results to PHP in a (lets call it) *random* order. Thanks @herregroen for pointing that out&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Reviewing a bit &lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/47048/47048-5.diff" title="Attachment '47048-5.diff' in Ticket #47048"&gt;47048-5.diff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/47048/47048-5.diff" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt;, noticed a few things:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Within &lt;code&gt;attachTabsPanelListeners&lt;/code&gt; the variable &lt;code&gt;selectAll&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt;: it needs to be declared at the top of the function. Please run &lt;code&gt;grunt jshint&lt;/code&gt; to lint the JS files
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While it is a partially pre-existing thing, could anyone please refresh my mind about the usage of &lt;code&gt;removeAttr( 'checked' )&lt;/code&gt; vs. &lt;code&gt;prop( 'checked', false )&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;prop( 'checked', true )&lt;/code&gt;? Genuinely asking.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'd rename &lt;code&gt;data-area&lt;/code&gt; to something along the lines of "data-items-type" or something like that to better clarify what it is.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Originally, the various "Select all" were links. It's a pattern that was commonly used in WordPress for no-js compatibility. Progressive enhancement: the basic functionality was available also whit JS off (see it was using a &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;selectall=1&lt;/code&gt; param). Now that the "Select All" are checkboxes and their functionality is based on JavaScript, when JS support is off they're hidden with the CSS class &lt;code&gt;hide-if-no-js&lt;/code&gt;. Personally I don't have objections to make this feature only available when JS is on but I guess the logic to check for &lt;code&gt;$_REQUEST['selectall']&lt;/code&gt; that's still in place should be removed?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
@birgire thanks for taking care of this issue. Do you have the bandwidth to address these points in the next days? Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
alltough I see that your ID resultset in mysql has duplicates I cannot reproduce this using:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
posts with 0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4 comments&lt;br /&gt;
paginated 2&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I do not have overlapping or missing posts in the list.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Still this might me an error because of the post_status. Could you run the queries and do them only for the publish post status?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

@peterwilsoncc Can you clarify the exact optimisation you'd like to make here? Is it the order in which &lt;code&gt;wp_delete_comment()&lt;/code&gt; gets called or is it optimisation within the function? Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Better patch with PHP and JS this time.&lt;br /&gt;
Rewritten to match latest trunk.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And .. does not expose the error to the world using this (and a filter thereafter)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;$sent_header = ( WP_DEBUG || ( is_user_logged_in() ) );
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If you want to test this you might need to disable this in handlers.js because it will loop forever in the current trunk versioning @azaozz &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;			// If the file is an image and the error is HTTP 500 try to create sub-sizes again.
			if ( status === 500 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; isImage ) {
				tryAgain( up, error );
				return;
			}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
@joemcgill thanks for your feedback. I do appreciate your observations and fair criticism.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I see in your reply you're mainly focusing on the technical side. I'd like to clarify my criticism isn't about technical solutions: it's definitely up to the Media team to identify the best path because of their expertise. My criticism is about the extended lack of activity on this ticket for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It appears we have different views on what the role of component maintainers and ticket owners are. I'd expect component maintainers to do their best to timely address issues that are considered serious issues by other teams. Instead, ticket owners don't necessarily have to code a patch or be technical persons.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Looking at the history of this ticket, following the chronological order of events, it's clear it didn't receive much attention. It was punted several times &lt;em&gt;skipping at least 4 entire release cycles&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The ticket was milestoned again for new release cycles a few times only because the accessibility team took action after discussing the ticket in their weekly bug scrubs. And then it was regularly punted again because of lack of activity. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The accessibility team is a small team: we don't have the resources to handle large amounts of tickets. We also lack technical expertise in some areas. That's the reason why we often ask for help and collaboration from other teams. Considering the history of this ticket, seeing it punted again &lt;em&gt;a few days before 5.3 Beta 1&lt;/em&gt; because of lack of activity is, frankly, terribly disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Today (September 23rd) at 15:00 UTC on the #accessibility Slack channel, the accessibility team would like to discuss where things stand in this release cycle and how the cross-team collaboration can be improved to be more effective. Everybody's welcome to join and share feedback.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

yes it will be better, my intentions are to set this up in order for another ticket/patch to sort of "translate" the error messages even better so real humans (end users) are able to go further at the point of error occurance&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;$this-&amp;gt;assertSame( 'custom-position', $actual_position, 'Menu not inserted at the expected position with ' . $test );
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
to help with debugging on failures, as it's a loop of assertions.&lt;br /&gt;

      <title>Ticket #48083 (Use `**` operator to replace`pow()` function calls) created</title>

      <pubDate>Fri, 20 Sep 2019 03:52:52 GMT</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Another ticket for a PHP 5.6+ enhancement. With PHP 5.6, we can use the &lt;code&gt;**&lt;/code&gt; operator instead of &lt;code&gt;pow()&lt;/code&gt; function. Doc page of &lt;code&gt;pow()&lt;/code&gt; function also suggests to use the operator.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Using the &lt;code&gt;**&lt;/code&gt; operator is about 4 times faster too.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;**&lt;/code&gt; operator: &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.operators.arithmetic.php"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.operators.arithmetic.php&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;pow()&lt;/code&gt; function: &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.pow.php"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.pow.php&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Simple benchmark: &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://3v4l.org/LMRcp"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://3v4l.org/LMRcp&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Attached patch below will fix the only 2 instances we have in WordPress code base. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
SimplePie and GetID3 libraries have this pattern more frequently. I see @jrf has created an issue in SimplePie about a new release, so I will open a PR there to see if we can get this in SimplePie upstream. GetID3 library requires PHP 5.3, so I don't think we can get this improvement to upstream. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;code&gt;34904.9.diff&lt;/code&gt; is looking great on my side too (see screenshots).&lt;br /&gt;
Maybe there is some room for disabled state color contrast enhancements in a next commit but it's a really great enhancement as it :)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Thanks for the responses. I realized the PHPCS failures in CI, and thanks a lot for the fixes and improvements with &lt;code&gt;require_once __DIR__&lt;/code&gt; pattern too! +1 from me too :)&lt;br /&gt;

Replying to &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/48082#comment:1" title="Comment 1"&gt;jrf&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;ol start="2"&gt;&lt;li&gt;As nearly all of these touch &lt;code&gt;include/require&lt;/code&gt; statements, may this be a good time to remove the unnecessary parentheses which are often used with them ?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;include&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;require&lt;/code&gt; are language constructs, not function calls and not using the parentheses has an - albeit marginal - performance benefit.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Bad:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;require_once&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;dirname&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;__FILE__&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'/admin.php'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Good:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;require_once&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;dirname&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;__FILE__&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'/admin.php'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;code&gt;WordPress-Extra&lt;/code&gt; PHPCS ruleset actually contains a sniff which already checks for this. If the unneeded parentheses would be removed, the sniff could move from the &lt;code&gt;Extra&lt;/code&gt; ruleset to the &lt;code&gt;Core&lt;/code&gt; ruleset. /cc @pento&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think this is a great idea, two birds with one stone and all that, or in other words, it would make SVN/Git blame a little nicer doing this at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
We should omit this check if the site is not running a core release. Running on trunk or point release nightlies will give an error. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Presumably the user knows and understands if they are not running a release version.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
