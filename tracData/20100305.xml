&lt;p&gt;
We'll need to put a warning above the GUU themes section reminding people that updating a theme could overwrite any changes they've made, etc.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That should probably be displayed in the Plugin &amp;amp; Theme editors too, linking to a codex article about child themes for the latter.
&lt;/p&gt;

You need to add _x to your tags, with the context flag. I belive &lt;code&gt;_x:2c,1&lt;/code&gt; should do it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you're using "update from sources" try "update from POT file" too..
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
_x IS translated, your client may need updating, or the .pot file you're working off might be incomplete..
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
@caesarsgrunt: As I said above, the testing was done on the version before the Edit link (2.5), and the Edit link was put in as a response to testing results. If you want to suggest new testing, as I mentioned before, feel free to. Just yesterday in the #wordpress-dev chat, in fact, I asked people if there were any areas they wanted tested when I conduct usability testing this coming week in Austin. No one brought up the edit link, because it apparently was not a priority for the developers involved. Sadly you didn't come to that meeting, nor did you comment on the meeting agenda or summary on wpdevel.wordpress.com to request it, nor have you just made the statement on this ticket, "Why don't we test it against a prototype without the edit link and see how they compare?" Seriously, all it takes is someone asking, and we can test it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If instead you'd rather question my integrity and call me a liar, which your comment basically does, then there is a bigger problem here than the edit link. If you really think this an appropriate way to gain support for an idea, then we have very different views on how to win friends and influence people.
&lt;/p&gt;

of course. but if memory serves, the .htaccess file gets refreshed whenever they're generated unless it's a soft refresh, or something like that.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The .htaccess rewrite rules are written once during the network install. They aren't refreshed from individual site/blog settings.

js_pass_check_a.diff is a development only patch for checking the second password field against the first. I tested out the code and it works perfect. Might want to check over the coding standards though. I didn't change the JavaScript files that are actually being used because I don't know how to minimize them.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Thank you so much for coming back to me on this. I've implemented the patch on a test site using the nightly build and so far so good.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I wasn't able to try it on my main site because I wouldn't know how to implement the patch as the canonical.php is different, so proper &amp;amp; full tire kicking might need to wait until 3.0 is ready for implementing on my main site.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Many thanks again. This could provide people with a nice little url shortening tool without risking losing any "Google juice" if people link to the propogated shorter url.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So you suggest duplicating the shortcode parser to parse HTML tags instead of shortcodes, so that we can remove the html tag on the fly if the image doesn't exist? It's an idea, but probably a lot more work than a new shortcode and it strikes me as a rather messy solution. Does anyone else have an opinion on this? Is anyone willing to try implementing it? (I don't have time right now.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Actually, it's a lot LESS work, because you won't have to modify the media system to create shortcodes as well.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Also, we have a pretty darned good HTML parser built right into the system. Look closely at kses. Finding the img codes in the content is trivial, parsing them into attributes is relatively easy with kses, and then taking action to then remove the img tag on the fly is relatively easy as well. The hard part is looking in the database to find trashed images.
&lt;/p&gt;

Of course; I'd forgotten.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'd be interested to see the results of your specific usability testing of the two edit links. Please quote it or give a url. Surely that's not too hard if it really exists? Google &lt;em&gt;site:wordpress.org edit link usability testing&lt;/em&gt; returns no relevant results.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Okay, the difference here is that I don't see any of those as real "problems".
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There is fundamentally no real difference between [image align=right url=whatever] and &amp;lt;img style="align:right;" src="whatever" /&amp;gt;. They are both amenable to machine creation and parsing. They both mean the same thing. Except that the HTML way works without further processing power being applied to it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you want to scan through posts and recognize faulty images to deal with trashed ones, then you can do so without a shortcode. Merely stick a class="attachment-123" on every image. Have a filter on the content look for images with that attachment class, and then remove the images which have been trashed. It's practically the same code, except you're using a regexp instead of a shortcode (which get found by regexps anyway).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You're wanting to change the way images are held in posts, and then build image tags. I'd rather you simply attacked the problem directly instead of coming at it sideways. There's better ways to solve all the "problems" you mention without breaking the current content model.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
@mhbar: Problem is, Otto's option doesn't solve any of the original problems! It just solves the minor problem of changing the siteurl (which would also be solved by the shortcode). ;-)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
@Otto: I agree that the shortcode has certain (minor IMO) disadvantages, but most of the problems you mention can be immediately solved by making the export function parse the shortcode (maybe it does already even?)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In this case, I think that as you say the media shortcode is a "necessary evil", since it solves far more problems than it creates.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Can you think of another solution that would solve the original problems? Obviously it's possible to parse every post upon deleting an image, and remove the code. That would solve one of the problems, but it would be a horrible and resource-intensive way to go about it. The shortcode would be much better than that.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Maybe we should have a poll or something? This is clearly an extremely important decision, since it affects the entire media handling of WordPress, and a couple of us discussing the benefits/problems of each system won't necessarily get something which makes the most people happy...
&lt;/p&gt;

Thanks dd32 for working on the patch. My other obligations come in waves, so I was just now checking on this. It was a nice surprise. I've already done a little research on the lack of JavaScript feedback for mis-matched passwords, so I'll make a patch for that.

One advantage to Otto's option is that it would only use cache'd data from the options table.  No extra DB access if I'm reading things correctly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My primary concern in all of this is to achieve more independence from hard coded URL's.   Either solution is just fine w/ our environment, and we'll be happy with *a* solution, vs the present state.
&lt;/p&gt;

Do New sites inherit the current options from the main site, or is it a complete static list? IIRC, It uses a static list? Perhaps certain options should be inherited from the main blog upon creation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Most settings are the same as a newly installed single WP. A few are conditional in populate_options. Also, in the Super Admin -&amp;gt; Options screen there are setting that affect a new site (ex. first post title &amp;amp; content).
&lt;/p&gt;

It's not about options, it's about widgets. When your template (as in, the loop) is widget-based, there is absolutely no reason to edit the slightest file.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That doesn't mean they won't.

It would be sweet to allow theme authors to remove that using a filter. Some themes are built in such a way that you don't need to edit the templates in order to customize them...
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
True, but some people will edit those themes anyway. not everything is covered in a theme options screen.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #10551 (wp_die() triggers block when using ModSecurity Core Rules) updated</title>

Please see also &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12341" title="#12341: defect (bug): Invalid feed type returns 500 HTTP response (closed: fixed)"&gt;#12341&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12529" title="#12529: defect (bug): Specify a response for more wp_die calls (closed: duplicate)"&gt;#12529&lt;/a&gt;.  Here's why &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt; don't like 500 errors (pasted from &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12529" title="#12529: defect (bug): Specify a response for more wp_die calls (closed: duplicate)"&gt;#12529&lt;/a&gt;):
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Part of the reason I want to do this, is that I've noticed that automated systems trying to break a site seem to see a 500 error as a clue that they are getting closer to their goal. They seem to pound a lot harder on the scripts that return 500 errors, so I'd like to clean these up and only return them when they're actually appropriate.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Currently wp_die is used 278 times in 86 files. However, we only specify an HTTP response code 3 times, which means 99% of these calls return a 500 status code.
&lt;/p&gt;

I should have linked to the &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;HTTP Status Code Definitions&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'll start out by mentioning the ones that have been plaguing me most.  If you look at wp-comments-post.php, it gives the following error messages, all returning 500 status codes:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sorry, comments are closed for this item.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think this should return a 403
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sorry, you must be logged in to post a comment.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think this should return a 401 Unauthorized
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Error: please fill the required fields (name, email).
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Honestly, I think this should return a 200.  It's an application error, but it seems like a 200 is appropriate.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Error: please enter a valid email address.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think this should be a 200 as well.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Error: please type a comment.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It seems like this should also be a 200.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I'm attaching a patch for the ones listed above.
&lt;/p&gt;

We'll need to put a warning above the GUU themes section reminding people that updating a theme could overwrite any changes they've made, etc.

Since moving to wp_die(), we've started returning 500 errors (the default) in a lot of cases where we shouldn't (see &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12341" title="#12341: defect (bug): Invalid feed type returns 500 HTTP response (closed: fixed)"&gt;#12341&lt;/a&gt;).  For example, wp-comments-post.php gives error messages like 'Error: please fill the required fields (name, email).' and 'Error: please enter a valid email address.' but it sends them with a 500 HTTP response along with them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Currently wp_die is used 278 times in 86 files.  However, we only specify an HTTP response code 3 times:
Once in wp-includes/comment.php, specifying a 403
Twice in wp-includes/functions.php, specifying a 404 and a 403
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I can't imagine that there are 275 times that we want to return a 500 response.  I'd like to use this ticket to point out specific places this should be changed, and figure out what it should be changed to.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Part of the reason I want to do this, is that I've noticed that automated systems trying to break a site seem to see a 500 error as a clue that they are getting closer to their goal.  They seem to pound a lot harder on the scripts that return 500 errors, so I'd like to clean these up and only return them when they're actually appropriate.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Yes, I tried chdir also but found it caused path errors later in the code. I fixed that by saving the current directory, then used chdir, and then restored the current directory. But I abandoned that approach and just took out the -a because if you look further down in the dirlist() function they skip the hidden directories anyway and they are never used.
&lt;/p&gt;

We'll need to put a warning above the GUU themes section reminding people that updating a theme could overwrite any changes they've made, etc.

Other things not mentioned: the CSS version numbers on wp-login.php.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And, my favorite: Simply try to hit a wp-admin or wp-includes file that was introduced after a certain version, and check to see whether you get a 200 or 404.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Setting to worksforme, as a plugin can remove generator tags. Otherwise, wontfix.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I'm currently experiencing this problem also. I'm fairly new to wordpress/php so shoot me if you think this is silly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I modified dirlist from
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;		$list = @ftp_rawlist($this-&amp;gt;link, '-a ' . $path, false);
		if ( empty($list) ) // Empty array = non-existent folder (real folder will show . at least)
			return false;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
to
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;		$chdir = @ftp_chdir($this-&amp;gt;link, $path);
		$list = @ftp_rawlist($this-&amp;gt;link, '-a');
		if ( empty($list) || !$chdir )
			return false;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
ftp_rawlist doesn't seem too happy when you stick '-a' to the front of the path, but is perfectly happy if you chroot there first and then call LIST -a.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'm not sure why this is the case, but it seemed to solve the problem for me.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Also, I downloaded the latest nightly build, that is what I am working on. Not sure what version number that is. As I said, I'm new to all this :)

There was no Edit link per comment in 2.5, the comment author name performed as an Edit link. It was changed in 2.7 per user feedback that over and ever contained, "I wish there was just an Edit link." The testing report was posted on the dev blog when that was done.

Replying to &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/11394#comment:28" title="Comment 28"&gt;caesarsgrunt&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you're opposed to an image specific shortcode, I'd agree that it might be a good idea instead to have a generic media one, since most of the attributes will be similar for all media.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Not opposed to it, as such, I just wanted to make it more generic and useful for more than just media.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don't like shortcodes in general, because IMO they pollute the content with site and/or system specific bits. The content can be displayed on the website, or in a feed, or pulled out and merged into other bits... I'd just like it to remain relatively pure and capable of being displayed in different ways. Shortcodes lock the content into an implementation-specific system.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But they do good things too, so while I think they're evil, I can see that they're a necessary evil.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With an media specific shortcode, you're locking the content to that database and implementation specifically. If you move the content to another system, it ceases to work. Images don't show. Links get broken or are not there. Etc, etc..
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In other words, my problem with the original suggestion is that I think [image] is a worse thing to have in the database than &amp;lt;img src...&amp;gt;, because HTML has a defined meaning outside of the database and WordPress and is well understood across multiple types of systems, but shortcodes only work in WordPress, with this specific code, with this specific theme/plugin, etc.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This may be a problem with no perfect solution, I grant you, but I'd like to make any content produced by the core still have some form of meaning and to display at least semi-properly even when the shortcodes are not processed.
&lt;/p&gt;

Sorry if the last bit of that comes off as a personal attack, Jane. I admire you for a lot of the work you do, and I respect your opinions, but I do think you are one of the worst of the core devs when it comes to ticket vetoing for apparently personal reasons, even if those are not the real reasons. It makes me and others very angry, and you would certainly do well to try to explain your reasons better if they are not just personal decisions.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Replying to &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/11273#comment:26" title="Comment 26"&gt;jane&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We are past feature freeze for 3.0, so anything that hasn't already been agreed upon by the lead developers as a task it too late for this version.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Certainly, but the normal way of punting a ticket is to change it to the next version (or, slightly contentiously, to Future Release) rather than just close it as &lt;em&gt;wontfix&lt;/em&gt; which means, believe it or not, that it has been decided not to fix it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If two people have a differing opinion on what is more usable, the answer is to test it with real users. Not with one person's clients, but in regular usability testing with a broad range of users. Action links on admin screens were  a big part of the testing on 2.5, and the way we designed 2.7 (which is what this thread is about, the 2.7 action link design) was based purely on that testing. If you would like to suggest another round of testing, that would be fine, but saying your opinion of a usability "bug" is more valid than the formal testing we did is just as aggravating. You assume decisions I promote are based on my opinion, and sometimes that's the case, but more often (and in this case) it's based on testing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sorry, I didn't know you had done specific testing regarding the issue of removing the Edit link, since you never mentioned this. perhaps you would post the results, or give us a link if they are already online?&lt;br /&gt;
Nor had I realised that this action link design was a specific part of the design for 2.7; I had assumed it was just an artifact from the combination of the old edit system and the new Quick Edit system. Again, you didn't mention this when closing the ticket.&lt;br /&gt;
Further, as anyone reading the ticket and comments can see, this is not merely my opinion against usability test results. This is the opinion of everyone else involved in the ticket except you, against what was presented as your opinion but you are now saying is based on UX testing. Either way, the opinions of a group of WP contributors should be considered and respected, even if it is eventually overruled by UX testing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And in some cases, a decision may be made not based only on what functionality exists today, or through plugins, but based on where we think the functionality will be going. If people missed a discussion or background on a decision (no one is involved in every single discussion in IRC, wpdevel, forums, hackers, ui group, etc) and think a decision the lead team has made is bad, if the person would ask why a decision had been made before complaining about it and saying it is ill-considered, maybe we could avoid some of this contention.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is not a one-off issue, it's a widespread opinion that the core devs are heavy handed in closing tickets they don't personally agree with.&lt;br /&gt;
If you consider this opinion unjustified it is up to you, the core devs, to fix it. Have you considered the fact that maybe it should be you, when you close a ticket, who should explain why "why a decision had been made" in order to avoid some of this contention?&lt;br /&gt;
In this case, for example, you clearly presented the decision as a personal one. If that was not the case, you have unnecessarily created a bad impression of yourself as a core dev, which you could have avoided by behaving in a more professional manner by explaining that it was in fact a team decision based on UX testing (if this is really the case).&lt;br /&gt;
It's no use blaming everyone else. Look at the root of the misunderstanding.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
We are past feature freeze for 3.0, so anything that hasn't already been agreed upon by the lead developers as a task it too late for this version.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If two people have a differing opinion on what is more usable, the answer is to test it with real users. Not with one person's clients, but in regular usability testing with a broad range of users. Action links on admin screens were  a big part of the testing on 2.5, and the way we designed 2.7 (which is what this thread is about, the 2.7 action link design) was based purely on that testing. If you would like to suggest another round of testing, that would be fine, but saying your opinion of a usability "bug" is more valid than the formal testing we did is just as aggravating. You assume decisions I promote are based on my opinion, and sometimes that's the case, but more often (and in this case) it's based on testing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And in some cases, a decision may be made not based only on what functionality exists today, or through plugins, but based on where we think the functionality will be going. If people missed a discussion or background on a decision (no one is involved in every single discussion in IRC, wpdevel, forums, hackers, ui group, etc) and think a decision the lead team has made is bad, if the person would ask why a decision had been made before complaining about it and saying it is ill-considered, maybe we could avoid some of this contention.
&lt;/p&gt;

My point remains that to me, Removing it doesnt make sense, It only appears to make it more secure, it doesnt infact do that at all.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I agree.  Removing the generator only hurts the good guys.  Quite frequently I'll take a look at source to see the version of WP used by the blog I'm commenting on, and then I'll send a quick email to the site owner if it's really old.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Most of the time I wouldn't bother trying to deduce the version from features, but from server logs I've seen, going after features seems to be a continual attack vector: bots don't always bother figuring out the version, they just hit the site with all known attacks.
&lt;/p&gt;

We could make this into a plugin as well. That might give us an indicator of how many people would use it.

Incidentally, I think it is &lt;strong&gt;much&lt;/strong&gt; better in the latest nightly with the lines mostly removed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I still think the spacing needs sorting out though.

      <title>Ticket #11869 (Multisite upgrade notice at wpmu-upgrade-site.php isn't steadily visible.) updated</title>
      
        <dc:creator>wpmuguru</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Fri, 05 Mar 2010 13:31:49 GMT</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
If we were to do all the site upgrades in sequence it would probably dramatically increase the failure rate of upgrades on larger sites. The 5 sites per screen with the short delay between screens is most likely a compromise between the speed of the upgrade and success rate of upgrades. Active plugins also affect the duration of the upgrade.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don't have access to statistics for the server capacity distribution across existing installs, so I wouldn't be comfortable with changing the number per screen without a second opinion.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Some things that we could do are:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;add a running tally at the top of the screen showing a total of how many updated
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;include the blog id &amp;amp; description with each site listed and a success/failure note
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;increase the delay between pages so the page is visible longer
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;on a failure give an option to retry that site and an option to proceed with the next one after the failed site (2nd opinion on this as well)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Yes, I realize that plugins can be used to fix WP's flaws, and I do often include a generic bugfix plugin in my installations of WordPress, for bugs the core devs have vetoed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
However, I think that bugfixes and usability fixes generally should be integrated into the WP core, and in particular I think that issues like this should not be closed as wontfix just on one person's opinion, when everyone else in the (admittedly brief so far) discussion has been in favour of it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I am becoming rather fed up with this attitude and I know that other contributors are too.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I don't like this change at all, and I consider it a regression. But if we are going to keep it, it needs at least to have some margin inserted on the outer sides of the tables as well as between them. Preferably the space should be even - the same between them as each side. And it would probably be better if the tables grew and shrunk rather than the space between them, if possible.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think a better solution to this problem would have been a grey line down the middle of the table, similar to the horizontal divisions between items.
&lt;/p&gt;

@caesarsgrunt: It's not a bug if it is how the developer intended it. It's a bug if it doesn't work as expected.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That should take care of some of the raised issues.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Remaining issues:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Remove the spacing between the numbers and their labels. There's a tiny break in the bottom border between the "78" and the "comments", for example, on my local installation.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make the spacing between the two columns fixed width, so the amount of space between the columns doesn't grow along with the page.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
As for the light break between the label and the rows, I've left the border to the top of the table, its not in a final resting place there, but should hopefully give something to start off.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'm not sure how to handle the fixed width between the columns, Should the 2 small columns be aligned left/right/center? Is it going to look strange like that? Too much whitespace to one side or all the content bunched up in the middle..
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I disagree that keeping standardized action links in unusable. This is a wontfix for 3.0. Removing the Edit link can be left to a plugin if someone feels strongly, like @caesarsgrunt.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Yes, after being told and seeing it in action once or twice then of course most users of average intelligence will be able to remember.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My point is that an interface shouldn't be so unintuitive that users have to be told and see it in action once or twice and then have to remember why there are two links serving the exact same purpose.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you look back at the original ticket and ensuing discussion, you'll see that my proposal created no accessibility problem as it uses the concept progressive enhancement, as used in the rest of WP and any accessible website. This means that if users do not have the required javascript to use Quick Edit, they are presented with the old edit link. Furthermore, I mentioned the idea Quick Edit could contain a link to "Advanced Edit".
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There is no accessibility loss caused by this suggested change, just a usability fix.
&lt;/p&gt;

dancole: My apologies, I didnt see your patch here before commiting pretty much the exact same thing (with a few extra checks).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This lacks Javascript feedback on mis-matching passwords, Does someone feel like taking a stab at that?

Missing a return in there.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There might be a better location for the has_taxonomy() function too, But i'm not too sure where all the other taxonomy functions are stored right now..

      <description>&lt;i&gt;Keywords&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Type&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Milestone&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It doesnt appear that Redirecting Rewritten URL's has ever been handled by the Canonical system for WordPress. Most of the code is for redirecting ?query=var to /query/something/var/.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'm going to attach a little-tested patch, please test it out, and try to break it if possible :)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
IMO, This may be fitting in as an enhancement since its not currently a handled case and is not a regression, which would mean relegating it to 3.1 as we're in 3.0 feature freeze.
&lt;/p&gt;

I hadnt noticed that it had been removed, as it was still in my file. Thats the reason for the followup commit which reverted that.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
AFAIK, This is by design.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Revisions should not be created for every draft autosave.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Revisions are only created of manual/final saves.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Sorry i can't open tickets on the wpmu trac.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On wpmu admin, Add New is not translated in the different menus.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
[wp-admin\menu.php]
Line 34 :         /* translators: add new post */
Line 35 :         $submenu&lt;a class="missing wiki"&gt;edit.php?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="changeset" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/10" title="WordPress branding.

Line 50 :         /* translators: add new file */
Line 51 :         $submenu&lt;a class="missing wiki"&gt;upload.php?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="changeset" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/10" title="WordPress branding.
"&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; = array( _x('Add New', 'file'), 'upload_files', 'media-new.php');
Line 55 :         /* translators: add new links */
Line 56 :         $submenu&lt;a class="missing wiki"&gt;link-manager.php?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="changeset" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/10" title="WordPress branding.
"&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; = array( _x('Add New', 'links'), 'manage_links', 'link-add.php' );
Line 61 :         /* translators: add new page */
Line 62 :         $submenu&lt;a class="missing wiki"&gt;edit-pages.php?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="changeset" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/10" title="WordPress branding.
"&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; = array( _x('Add New', 'page'), 'edit_pages', 'page-new.php' );
Line 73 :         $submenu&lt;a class="missing wiki"&gt;themes.php?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="changeset" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/15" title="Use new features (texturize etc.) by default.
"&gt;[15]&lt;/a&gt; = array(&lt;span class="underline"&gt;('Add New Themes'), 'install_themes', 'theme-install.php');
Line 82 :         /* translators: add new plugin */
Line 83 :         $submenu&lt;a class="missing wiki"&gt;plugins.php?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="changeset" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/10" title="WordPress branding.
"&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; = array(_x('Add New', 'plugin'), 'install_plugins', 'plugin-install.php');
Line 94 :         $submenu&lt;a class="missing wiki"&gt;users.php?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="changeset" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/10" title="WordPress branding.
"&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; = array(_x('Add New', 'user'), 'create_users', 'user-new.php');
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I tried with adding _x to the poEdit tags, but this didn't work. All other items are translated.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Accessibility it more important. Any user should be able to understand the distinction, as it's an application-wide convention. If they can't, even after seeing it in action once or twice, then they fall outside the range of the average user. Someone can write a plugin to remove the edit link if they think their users will have that much trouble.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
If we decide to not show the password on the subsequent screen, we will have to add a "Type password again" field to the original screen, otherwise the user might accidentally make a typo and does not really know about.
&lt;/p&gt;

I believe it is intentional, as there was discussion about users getting confused to wherer the comments belonged to or something like that. (I believe that's how Jane described it.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I haven't read all of it, but there's a lot of discussion on this by the UI people: &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://make.wordpress.org/ui/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://make.wordpress.org/ui/&lt;/a&gt;

get_tag_link() doesn't support custom taxonomies. There needs to be an API for getting custom taxonomy links. Patches welcomed :)

Additionally, and that is not that visible in the trac patch browser, &lt;em&gt;pre_template_include&lt;/em&gt; is building a good pair to &lt;em&gt;template_include&lt;/em&gt;, a principle that you can find more and more often within the codebase.

After another 42 hours, this still looks inconsistent to me. I have problems to verify what's said, because I've never seen @author tags removed prior to commit (which must be no surprise) while even today I stumbeled over @author in trunk (not taking external libraries into account if I remember correctly). Also the information of which authors ryan spoke is missing. Additionally the note in the codex page just has been removed. Just to recap the timeline:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I will try to gather even more attention from the free software community to clarify the attribution/naming of authors issues regarding the status of the copyright and GPL. I think the more information there is, the better it is.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
From the projects I know of, which do not want to have author-credited-code inside their trunk, they communicate that upfront. I think that should be done in the wordrepss project as well if that is what is wanted so a contributer knows with what she/he has to deal with.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Maybe it is a suggestion to let the names in there but remove the @author tags?
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I see some HTML5 partly flowing into 2010 (example: &lt;a class="changeset" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/13565" title="Use a short HTML5-style charset declaration in twentyten, props ..."&gt;r13565&lt;/a&gt;) but I also see some of the recommendations for HTML5 not in it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I have no background information about the state of that theme regarding the decision for or against a specific HTML version. So I need to ask:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Is this little HTML5 in there to actually camouflage the theme being HTML5 or is it in as a statement to actually make use of it? Just curious.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A very speaking example is the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div id="header"&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; / &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;header&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; demo in this &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://diveintohtml5.org/semantics.html"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; which actually provides a &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://diveintohtml5.org/examples/blog-html5.html"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;html5 blog mockup sample page&lt;/a&gt; which seems ideally convenient as a pattern for something like a wordpress theme.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Are there any plans to adopt HTML5 for the theme? Looks like many new HTML elements are available for semantic web publishing WP could make use of.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Is there some other area the version number is displayed publicly?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
No, Just the generator tags.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That does not mean the exact revision cannot be infered, As i said, by the size of the various JS/CSS files, and the existance of certain files.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I have seen a few exploit scripts which checked for the existance of a file before attempting an attack, and modifying it slightly for an earlier version.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My point remains that to me, Removing it doesnt make sense, It only appears to make it more secure, it doesnt infact do that at all. If someone doesnt want that information publically available in the page source, they just need to remove the generator lines.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Removing it still serves no purpose given its easy to figure out.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Removing the whole string serves the purpose to not provide that information any longer (especially the version number has implications with security).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Is there some other area the version number is displayed publicly?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For standard setups I would not care, if you want to harden a setup, such information shoulde be removed or tainted, e.g. making it a 2.6.1 wanna-bee.
&lt;/p&gt;

FWIW, the other half of this bug, where posts are magically not being saved at all, is caused by qTranslate.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Currently, the best workaround is to use WordPress 2.8.

Incorporating the flush with your install should do the trick w/o manually visiting a page.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
By leaving deprecated functions in core forever, wordpress will gradually become bloated. Much better to remove them a certain number of releases after they are deprecated. If due warning is given at the time of deprecation, in can hardly cause any problems. I can see no reason to carry on supporting deprecated functions for more than a year or two after they were deprecated.
&lt;/p&gt;

Just curious, since I've not been involved in dev for a while - what is the advantage of having to register the stylesheet, as in this system, rather than automatically detecting it as is done for other theme files?

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
since I last looked (two months ago... I've been out of touch for a while) the Right Now box has become really ugly due to a big split down the middle. Is the change intentional? Presumably not? See attached screenshot.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Just noticed that after the user chooses a password, it is shown in plaintext on the next page (presumably a hangover from when it used to be generated and so had to be shown). This is a &lt;strong&gt;major&lt;/strong&gt; security flaw. Just as password entry fields always use asteriscs or bullets rather than showing plaintext, so that people in the vicinity don't see the password being entered, the password should not be shown here in plaintext. The issue is, in fact, more severe than just a password entry field, since (a) the information is shown for longer and (b) the page could be cached under some circumstances, with potentially disastrous results.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Can anyone think of a reason to show the password here, or can we remove it?
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
My understanding is autop is what is adding/removing the blank lines. That isn't a problem.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
However if you look at my first example, the closing &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; tag is incorrectly being moved up above the heading and text by the visual editor. This shouldn't happen, and I'm not sure what is causing it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
These changes are being made just by switching to the visual editor and back to HTML. It has nothing to do with the actual saving of the page text.
&lt;/p&gt;

If you're opposed to an image specific shortcode, I'd agree that it might be a good idea instead to have a generic media one, since most of the attributes will be similar for all media.

I'm afraid Otto's suggestion basically defeats the object of this suggestion in the first place, since the only thing it allows to change dynamically is the siteurl. Looking back to the original ticket, advantages which wouldn't be supported with Otto's system include:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;allowing images to be trashed&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;allowing plugins and themes to modify the code used to show images&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;removing broken img tags from posts when the image is deleted&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In fact; all the advantages I listed. So, what's the point?
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I'm reopening this because it introduces a regression.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While the initial intent (not allowing multiple user registration) is reasonable, it introduces a problem as follows:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Set up WP
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An admin user is created
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;User's email is set to my email address
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I want my posts to show up as from me.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So I create a new user (me) with my address.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Before this fix, this worked. After this fix, it stopped working. So, today, when I did a fresh install, I had to enter a bogus email and then change it in the DB backend.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Another option would be to be able to change the default admin account's username, but that can be problematic - better to just allow the creation of multiple accounts with the same address from the admin panel (perhaps with warning).
&lt;/p&gt;

Looks like the since 1.5 exising funky_javascript_fix is not used any longer. no usage within core code.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I suggest to put on the deprecated list.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
The function &lt;em&gt;wp_unregister_GLOBALS&lt;/em&gt; contains uppercase letters which breaks the specs which call for all functions containing lowercase letters only and using underscores to separate words.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since function names are case insensitive in PHP, this can be easily fixed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Additionally some other of the more basic Wordpress coding standards are not followed in that function which can be fixed.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If a theme didn't register support for nav_menu, a message would be displayed in the admin custom nav page explaining lack of support: &lt;br /&gt;
"The current theme does not support Custom Navigation."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If a theme does support, it should display a message that WP is using the fall-back wp_pages_menu (wp_menu_pages?) and a message suggesting customizing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
+1 on this idea. Added to my patch.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And if their is a way for theme devs to specify a default fallback menu (perhaps by registering like a sidebar and defining options) then it should populate and use that menu until user overwrites with customizations, no? (if this is too much, perhaps in 3.1)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The fallback is set for each menu using the 'fallback_cb' argument in wp_nav_menu();

      <description>&lt;i&gt;Keywords&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The current problem is that now plugins dealing with custom content types all store that data in different places. This means that it is very hard to manage and that when the plugin is removed you loose all the defined custom content. It also means that you have different plugins defining custom content differently and not being able to interact with each other.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If this is by design it seems that the design may need improvement. What are the actual draw backs of storing this small data in table, all custom content plugins are already doing this in their own haphazard way?
&lt;/p&gt;

Seems like the right solution is for WordPress to be designed for security.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yes, and security by obscurity is not good security. The right solution is for WP to be designed in such a way that knowing the prefix is useless.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I know with Dreamhost, for example, when the 1-click installer is used, a random prefix is always inserted. Why can't this be the case for manual installations by default? It's silly to assume everyone uses a 1-click installer for Wordpress.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This seems like a known vulnerability that WP devs are purposely going to avoid fixing, and it'll be sad if the day comes that this vulnerability is exploited on a mass scale.
&lt;/p&gt;

Vive la France!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here's a patch. I converted the ul#sidemenu to a normal, non-floated UL. It looks like normal but can now handle very long lines. It don't look too pretty when it breaks up to two rows but them's the breaks, eh?
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Rewrote the function, to avoid duplicate code.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Also, if $output is not 'names', the function returns an associative array: $tax_name =&amp;gt; $taxobj
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
See get_taxonomies.2.diff

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
At least one XML-RPC client (MaStory on Maemo) does not set the type parameter on uploaded objects. This means we don't create appropriate thumbnails correctly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Given some clients are on fairly low-power, simple devices, it's probably worth Wordpress attempting to determine the mime-type, especially as functions calls we /already/ make on attachments will give us that information already for the common-case of image uploads.
&lt;/p&gt;

After more thought, get_taxonomies() would be quite handy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
get_object_taxonomies(), along with the rest of the functions, could be made to use it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Maybe add the $output parameter to get_object_taxonomies() instead of adding a new function.

I'm not sure this is needed, since you would use get_object_taxonomies() most of the time.

Replying to &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/11817#comment:285" title="Comment 285"&gt;ryan&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The default menu creation was to avoid confusion over why the theme showed something and the menus admin showed nothing.  Also, having no menus at all present by default was confusing.  Those were the motivations, anyhow. There is perhaps a better way to address them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
IMO, wp_nav_menu()'s fallback function is good enough as it provides an optional replacement if the menu doesn't exists. Having WP create yet another fallback method makes things confusing. Plus, for those who don't use wp_nav_menu() it makes things even more confusing as what's being displayed in the backend is not what's actually in the front-end.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Modifying Classic is a very bad idea. For example on WordPress.com we have 3 themes that are classic templates:
$ ack 'Template: classic'
banana-smoothie/style.css
7:Template: classic
blue-green/style.css
8:Template: classic
silver-black/style.css
8:Template: classic
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
WordPress has a function for retrieving all post types based on a certain criteria called get_post_types(). Taxonomies should have this kind of API too.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The URL field on Edit Menu Item isn't focusable in Chrome.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The url field is disabled for pages and categories.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
@wpmuguru: the default menu is being created late in the stack which is why it takes a second page load to appear. I think there was an agreement to axe the default menu creation as there's already a fallback function call for wp_nav_menu().
&lt;/p&gt;

Fixed would require some action by the commiters, therefore changing to "invalid".
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;i&gt;Cc&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Also experience config issues when trying to install the latest trunk version (13585) on my localhost LAMP with Apache v2.2.11 / MySQL v5.1.30 / PHP v5.2.8.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After you have entered the credentials in step one of the config I just get an empty screen for step 2 (url: /wp-admin/setup-config.php?step=2).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When I copy over a wp-config.php file from an other WP installation then WP works straight away without any issues so it looks like the config process is somehow broken.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Not really sure if this is related to the issue westi is describing here but I believe I don't have curl installed either.
&lt;/p&gt;

I've narrowed it down to an error thrown by jQuery.farbtastic.
Even when the div#colorPickerDiv is not shown, the call to farbtastic color picker is made.

      <title>Ticket #12515 (Destructive Autosaves Happening on All Drafts) created</title>
      
        <dc:creator>miqrogroove</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Thu, 04 Mar 2010 18:13:57 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12515</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12515/1267726437000000</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I'm investigating reports of post drafts magically reverting or not being saved at all.  This appears to be happening at random, and so far I cannot find the cause.  In the meantime, I have discovered a related problem: WordPress 2.9.2 is continuously overwriting drafts during editing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Steps to Reproduce:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create a New Post
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol start="2"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Click Save Draft (or wait for autosave)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol start="3"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Edit the content and wait 60 seconds.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol start="4"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Repeat step 3 as many times as you like.  Go to other pages.  Come back.  Do anything other than click Save Draft, and WordPress will repeatedly overwrite the saved information without creating any revisions or autosave records.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This is especially destructive if in step 2 the draft was autosaved by WordPress.  In that case, there are no revisions at all.  If you clear the content at that point, WordPress essentially deletes your draft without confirmation.
&lt;/p&gt;

I just tried a clean install of trunk on a MacPorts apache2/php5/mysql5 setup without curl installed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This tries to use the fopen WP_HTTP_Streams HTTP implementation and I was getting a WSOD when it went off to fetch the secret keys from the API.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
In our environment we have the field "permalink_structure" set up automatically on installation due to our many wordpress installations.  Around 25-30 a day.  The bug arrives because everything installs correctly but when you select any page besides the home page you are met with a 404 error.  However if you go to the "permalinks" tab in the wordpress interface and then go back to your site...the site works correctly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Therefore the fix is just to visit the "permalinks" tab.  You don't even have to click save changes, only visit the page.  Somehow our "custom structure" of "/%category%/%postname%.html" upon installation isn't activated until we actually visit the page.  This is a problem...because our blog is set up automatically with database scripts and we don't have time to manually go to each wordpress installation and click on the "permalinks" tab.  Thanks
&lt;/p&gt;

How would this affect people who change their uploads path?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Wouldn't it be better to pull [uploadurl] from wherever the miscellaneous stores it?  That way, if you changed the location, it would magically update.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
No, bad idea. Changing the upload location in the settings page doesn't actually move the files around, it just makes new files go to the new place.
&lt;/p&gt;

I don't know how this would work with Multi-Site, though, since as of 3.0, you can't change that setting easily.

Just a note on this bug.. I'm running on OS X, and I'm experiencing the same thing in FF... I can't login to any other network sites I've created but can login to the main parent site.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I posted a ticket on this, but maybe it's better served here.  The "background" menu option under Appearance seems to break the sidebar widget toggle ability.  Selecting any other menu item brings back the toggle as expected.  Thanks!

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Using changeset 13583, when I am on the "Background" Menu in the "Apperance" section, all of the admin sidebar widgets lose their toggle ability.  Select any other menu option and the toggle works as expected.  If I was a better developer, I'd totally submit the patch myself... give me time, I'll get there. ;)

&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Can I suggest we instead use an underscore as content_url, plugin_url, home_url, site_url, etc. for readability but more importantly for consistency with function names of the same use, i.e. &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/9008" title="#9008: task (blessed): add a home_url() function to enforce http/https scheme (closed: fixed)"&gt;#9008&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Shortcodes are meant to be typed by users, generally. Having underscores in them makes that confusing/difficult for some users. Dashes, perhaps.
&lt;/p&gt;

Thank you for the help! I will alert the plugin author.

try something like this, then:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;$post-&amp;gt;ID = time();
while ( wp_cache_get($post-&amp;gt;ID, 'posts')
  $post-&amp;gt;ID += time();
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
also, don't forget to do the following on the shutdown hook, for memcached users:
&lt;/p&gt;

I'm open to that function being renamed or moved elsewhere, which is why i've left this open for now.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As nacin said, I'd hit this before, thus, didnt notice the Add New themes item had been removed already.. See &lt;a class="changeset" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/13583" title="Remove the now defunct Add New Themes menu item accidentally re-added ..."&gt;[13583]&lt;/a&gt; which removed it again.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Priority is set to 101 to hook late after all plugins should've run (I cant think of a reason a plugin would hook to 100, but just in case)

&lt;p&gt;
Anyone have a solution to suggest?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Do New sites inherit the current options from the main site, or is it a complete static list? IIRC, It uses a static list? Perhaps certain options should be inherited from the main blog upon creation.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Right now the Install Themes screen has a search and a feature filter. You would expect the feature filter to be a search narrowing tool, but it actually just performs a search for the tags selected. It was supposed to be an advanced search sort of thing, not two separate searches. Somehow I never noticed that it was that way.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We should change it so the feature filter link comes after the search box, and the submit button is on the line below, so if the filter link is clicked, the expanded layer is still above the submit button, so the search could be done on keyword + tag.
&lt;/p&gt;

I agree, I'm going to close this as wontfix.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I do think that some extra documentation could do in the wild, but i dont think this is a place to discuss that, people posting their experiences on their blogs will help those later down the line through google searches :)

&lt;p&gt;
Well what about just having &amp;lt;meta name="generator" content="WordPress" /&amp;gt; as default then, without the version number
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Which removes useful data for random surveys, and doesnt fit with the normal Generator tags (being Application/Version). Removing it still serves no purpose given its easy to figure out.
&lt;/p&gt;

I like your idea, scribu.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And I suggest not only doing it for /page/, but also for /trackback/ and /comment-page-X/, as they also seem to be hardcoded &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/wp-includes/rewrite.php#L1297"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Presently the available (default) post_types and post_statuses are stored in wp-includes/post.php and called on init.
Shouldn't they be stored in the DB (perhaps in the options table). This would make it much easier / cleaner to add / manage custom post_types.
Essentially as the post_type array contains meta-data about that posts of that type I don't believe that it is good practice to store that statically.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This could be very easily implemented for 3.0 release and clean up a whole lot of hacking / issues and make a uniform way of storing custom post_types.
&lt;/p&gt;

Replying to &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/11394#comment:20" title="Comment 20"&gt;Otto42&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'd prefer shortcodes for specific URLs that could be put into posts. Example:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;&amp;lt;img src="[homeurl]/wp-content/uploads/whatever.jpg" /&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
We could have contenturl, pluginurl, homeurl, siteurl, etc. Each of these is a relatively simple single line function for a shortcode. It would serve to make the content less dependent on the absolute URL, but not too dependent on the shortcodes (since a simple search/replace of [homeurl] with the actual URL could fix up the content in the database).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A big +1.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Can I suggest we instead use an underscore as content_url, plugin_url, home_url, site_url, etc. for readability but more importantly for consistency with function names of the same use, i.e. &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/9008" title="#9008: task (blessed): add a home_url() function to enforce http/https scheme (closed: fixed)"&gt;#9008&lt;/a&gt;

Also, when I say IE7, I mean we were using IE8 with compatibility mode turned on.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We only have IE6 and IE8 test installs.

        <dc:creator>jamescollins</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Thu, 04 Mar 2010 04:02:27 GMT</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
We have noticed a strange problem with the visual editor in IE6 and IE7.  IE8, Firefox 3.5, and Safari 4.x don't have the same problem.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using IE6 or IE7, create a new page in WordPress.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol start="2"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Switch to the HTML editor.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol start="3"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Paste in the following page text:
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;img src="blah.jpg" /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Heading&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
text
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
rest of page
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;ol start="4"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Switch back to the Visual editor.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol start="5"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Switch back to the HTML editor. The text is now:
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src="blah.jpg" alt="" /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Heading&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
text
rest of page
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Notice how the closing &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; tag has been moved up above the "text" and &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt; code?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the other hand, using this code (same as above, but without the &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt; code):
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;img src="blah.jpg" /&amp;gt;
text
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
rest of page
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
produces:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src="blah.jpg" alt="" /&amp;gt;
text&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
rest of page
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;img src="blah.jpg" /&amp;gt;
text 1
text 2
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
rest of page
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
ie it doesn't move the &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; tag. Similarly,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;img src="blah.jpg" /&amp;gt;
text 1
text 2
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
rest of page
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
produces:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src="blah.jpg" alt="" /&amp;gt;
text 1
text 2&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
rest of page
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
doesn't move the &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; tag either.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I have been able to replicate this on WordPress 2.9.2, WPMU 2.9.2.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It is also still a problem on the latest trunk version (&lt;a class="changeset" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/13580" title="use correct variable, see #11817"&gt;r13580&lt;/a&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I couldn't find any existing bug reports for this, but I did find some similar older bugs:
&lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6610" title="#6610: defect (bug): When saving in Firefox, TinyMCE alters the inside of &amp;lt;pre&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;code&amp;gt; tags. (closed: fixed)"&gt;#6610&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3492" title="#3492: defect (bug): Visual Rich Editor wipes out various CSS class or style attributes (closed: fixed)"&gt;#3492&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/7345" title="#7345: defect (bug): TinyMCE adds extra spaces after HTML element close (closed: invalid)"&gt;#7345&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is causing a lot of trouble with our clients, who mostly use Internet Explorer. When they edit the pages that we have created for them using the HTML editor, our custom divs get moved around.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
jmabe and I made a product / plugin called &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://www.dsidxpress.com/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;dsIDXpress&lt;/a&gt; for the company we work for. It makes an API call to our servers for the data and returns the markup in the context of a fake post. We went back and forth between post ID 0 and -1 and ultimately choose -1 because of the get_permalink issue.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here's the relevant source for the plugin: &amp;lt;&lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/dsidxpress/trunk/client.php"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/dsidxpress/trunk/client.php&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;. The Activate function is where the fake post is created.
&lt;/p&gt;

can you expand a bit on what you'd like to do? it clear you want to create a fake post of sorts, but it would help understand why in order to make better sense of the ticket...

Replying to &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12413#comment:1" title="Comment 1"&gt;dd32&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The reason the query vars are set to false is due WP_Query handling the query vars manually for those taxonomies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Adding the query vars has some side effects i believe.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I guess this calls for a more holistic approach. Will probably be addressed in &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/9951" title="#9951: enhancement: Add [taxonomy]__in, [taxonomy]__not_in to wp_query (closed: duplicate)"&gt;#9951&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What are the problems plugins are running into?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'm enhancing my &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/query-multiple-taxonomies/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;Query Multiple Taxonomies&lt;/a&gt; to allow term intersections and I need to treat tags and categories like a regular taxonomy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I guess it's not such a common problem. :)
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
For what it's worth, post_id 0 won't work without some changes to the get_permalink function as it uses 0 as the default. If you emulate a post object so that you can return 100% custom content, get_permalink needs to be overridden and needs to have a non-zero post ID passed to it.
&lt;/p&gt;

if we decide to keep the regexp, it should at least be fixed, e.g.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;$domains = array('foo.com', 'bar.com');
$domains = implode('|', array_map('preg_quote', $domains));
if ( preg_match( "#^https?://(?:www\.)?(?:$domains)/#i", ...

I'd like to suggest a tiny enhancement to this patch: remove the regexp outright. it's not anchored, and as such serves no purpose beyond slowing things down.

@Ryan - when the user goes into the menu option for the first time no menu is displayed although it was created. I think it tracks back to the term caching where it looks like the first call to get the menu terms gets an empty set &amp;amp; the second call gets the empty set from cache. I wasn't sure where the cache clearing should be handled (ex. wp_insert_term), so I didn't attempt to fix.
&lt;/p&gt;

In pagination_base.2.diff I've simply made pagination_base a variable in the WP_Rewrite class. It seems consistent with all the rest of the vars.

&lt;p&gt;
I like were you're going with this, but please open your own ticket.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I will, but my main point here is that &lt;code&gt;get_pagination_base&lt;/code&gt; be marked private.  No need to expose a public API for this.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;i&gt;Owner&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Status&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The remaining issue is actually renaming an active theme. We should add a sanity check to current_theme_info() that if &lt;code&gt;$theme[$current_theme]&lt;/code&gt; isn't set, when we clear the 'current_theme' option and attempt to &lt;code&gt;get_current_theme()&lt;/code&gt; again.
&lt;/p&gt;

A note related to the ternary operators that can be found in the callback functions as well:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ternary operators are fine, but always have them test if the statement is true, not false. Otherwise it just gets confusing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Found in the &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;coding standards&lt;/a&gt;.

      <description>&lt;i&gt;Cc&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Type&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
As I understand it, it's not so much whether the user can edit a specified content type, but rather whether the user can edit a particular piece of content. The differences in abilities for e.g. editing posts published by other users are, I believe, the reason that each piece of content is checked, rather than its type.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Note: I don't believe this is really a defect; changed to enhancement.
&lt;/p&gt;

Let me start by saying I'm 100% into this whole idea!  I love it!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I like Otto42's suggestion.  That allows from optimal flexibility in the image tag.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If we did do a complete image shortcode, i would like to propose that we offer support for things like "rel" or maybe an attribute for thickbox.
&lt;/p&gt;
