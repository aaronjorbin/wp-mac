You also can say we should check if the theme supports post thumbnail. And only allowed get/update/remove when the theme does support it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This. or at least, that's what I expect to be done. If a site doesn't support something, you don't expose that functionality.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There's a reason the Admin UI only exists when the theme/post type supports the functionality..
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When the site changes to a theme that supports it, then you can expose it.. allowing something not supported by the theme to be set just seems poor UX to me.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Actually, we should be checking whether the post type supports thumbnails. Technically both post type and theme must support them for them to actually "work", but there's nothing wrong with getting/setting thumbnails even if the current theme doesn't support them (because the site could change to a theme that does at a later point in time).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One thing I noticed is it strips out any use of &lt;code&gt;title=&lt;/code&gt; in links.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Titles on links (or other tags) seem to work properly here. Could you try to trace where are they stripped.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It's nice that if you type double quotes for caption links in the HTML editor then switching to VIsual editor makes them single quotes, but is there a way we could also do the same thing for people who only use the HTML editor?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Don't think so. We aren't running any pre-save filters on the content of the HTML editor and I think most people that use it would insist on that. It's a simple case of using the right quotes, I mean &lt;code&gt;$str = "single quote is ok here";&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;$str = 'double quote is ok here';&lt;/code&gt;, same as in any html tag. Also people that use the HTML editor usually "know what they are doing" :)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We aren't planning to stick with the "Add link" UI that's in trunk right now are we? I'm a bit confused but it sounds like Sushkov's patches to add quicktags is the right way to go.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Still undecided (see the above comment on that). Using Quicktags would make it better for people that use the HTML editor and have at least some basic understanding of HTML. For the big majority of users it wouldn't make any difference though.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yes, the current "Add link" button and UI would need some polishing if we decide to keep it.
&lt;/p&gt;

It's how you look at the problem. You also can say we should check if the theme supports post thumbnail.
And only allowed get/update/remove when the theme does support it.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
FWIW I'd be satisfied with &lt;strong&gt;no&lt;/strong&gt; UI for adding links in the popups. IMHO the bug was that it was impossible, so as long as me and my users can type in an &amp;lt;a&amp;gt; tag and have it work that's a huge step forward. The fact that people who don't know HTML can use the Visual editor is also very logical. While it may not be a perfect implementation, it's both pretty easy to figure out that the Visual editor can do it and dead-simple to explain to someone ("Oh, just use the WYSIWYG button after inserting the image"). Of course, having a UI would be good for promoting the fact that HTML works in captions now, but that doesn't seem like a huge priority to me especially while it's so new.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Overall, I'd say if we can't get at least the quicktags (if not the full visual/html editor) then we're better off without a link button complicating the UI. To me it's more confusing to have just that one button than to have the whole row, because the row is already familiar and has a clear relationship to the textarea.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Also, in the current 'add link' button hitting enter does not do what I'd expect. Instead of inserting the link it causes the whole popup to close and insert the image into the post. If we keep the 'add link' button (or integrate it into quicktags) it would be good to change that, as it was really confusing and I also lost my work on the link (not much work but still).
&lt;/p&gt;

If there's an API for something, use it, don't reinvent the wheel.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That's fair, though the proposed change doesn't remove all references to _thumbnail_id (see markoheijnen's comment above about &lt;code&gt;get_post_thumbnail_id&lt;/code&gt;). I personally would prefer consistency (all wrappers or all *_post_meta), but I'll defer to the core devs.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
The prohibition on Apache/GPLv3 extend to the JavaScript libraries as per policy? I can't imagine it's a concern that a core developer may read non GPLv2 code from a JavaScript library marked with a GPLv2 incompatible license (but GPLv2 compatible license) and contaminate core with that JavaScript. Perhaps the prohibition should be that the non-library PHP code in the plugin should be "GPLv2" but the plugin as a whole can be "GPL compatible"? (I mean the concern is php code reuse right?)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Is there a Matrix of sorts (like &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#AllCompatibility"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#AllCompatibility&lt;/a&gt; ) that allows "GPLv2 or later" to contain "GPLv2 only" or "GPLv2 or later" PHP code, while using "GPLv2 or later," "GPLv3," or "Apache 2.0" licensed libraries? (I can't figure it out.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I've would have to move my plugin to a "GPL3" or "GPLv3 or later" license if it's not valid to license the combined package of the "GPLv2" and "GPLv2 or later" PHP code with JavaScript libraries (licensed as "MIT" and "Apache 2.0") as a "GPLv2 or later" plugin. Up til now I've believed that I've licensed it correctly. (The addition of the Apache 2 licensed library is very recent.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Judging from this ticket tho, I may have to hire a lawyer, remove the library, or switch to GPLv3 and stop hosting it on wordpress.org (which would suck).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
(Alternatively, I could write the plugin in a way that remotely pulls in and possibly caches the less.js library so that it's external and doesn't impact licensing, but that's a hoop and a half ain't it...)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On a related note, I've spend many hours looking for tutorials on how to properly mark and license code all with no luck. Specifically, I'd like to know how to mark the php classes and functions that I've written from scratch as copyrighted and licensed one way, and the code I've borrowed from core as marked as appropriate, and a combined plugin copyright and license markup. I've not found any tutorials anywhere for this.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Why's this stuff gotta be so hard. Also, you shouldn't rely on the license header line (or any other self declaration) being correct as coders barely understand what to put there.
&lt;/p&gt;

I don't see what's gained by calling these wrapper functions instead of calling the post meta functions directly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If there's an API for something, use it, don't reinvent the wheel.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
get_post() calls are inexpensive (and they're cached) in the global scheme of things, Validation happens for a reason, and finally, If core changes anything, its best to only do it in one location.  If there's anything in core that doesn't use the wrappers, feel free to open a ticket to update it.. In many cases the wrappers simply didn't exist at the time.

In my eyes better code. When there are WordPress methods what does the work for you, you should use it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When removing the checks what I did most of the checks happen in set_post_thumbnail().
The only issue know is that it does a get_post on the post ID. I'm curious what the opinion is from westi or any other core contributor.
&lt;/p&gt;

Basically the following code is enough and the more get_post calls isn't there anymore.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I meant the work that happens inside &lt;code&gt;delete_post_thumbnail&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;set_post_thumbnail&lt;/code&gt;, which each perform a &lt;code&gt;get_post&lt;/code&gt; and some validation that is redundant for our purposes (since we've already done the requisite checks).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One reason I would disable &lt;code&gt;wpLink&lt;/code&gt; in image popus, is because wpLink itself is a popup...
...Static &lt;code&gt;wpeditimage.html&lt;/code&gt; needs a bunch of js files in header to make it work...
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The problem is that the default "link" in Quicktags is... quite bad. It opens a browser generated modal popup (for the url) which is most basic (and uglier) UI we can have (unfortunately there's no other way to do it in Quicktags). Also don't think we can use wp-link in some places and not use it in other. The UI needs to be consistent.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The current UX/UI questions are:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shall we add Quicktags on the Image Caption fields.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;With Quicktags we can have 2-3 more buttons that insert HTML tags but the "link" button opens an ugly modal popup.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Without Quicktags we only have a "link" button but the UI/UX is better.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It may be possible to tweak Quicktags' link button to use the current link UI. Would that be the best option.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In both cases we would be showing the raw HTML code there.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Another inconsistency is that the "Caption" fields would have some sort of HTML editor but the "Description" fields would not. Description is actually the post_content and supports HTML.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shall we try to steer the users into editing captions directly into the visual editor. This is by far the best place to edit captions as all is wysiwyg, the image together with the caption usually looks exactly the same as on the front-end. An idea on how we can do that is to add a third button when clicking on an image in the visual editor. That button would be for adding (and removing) the caption "wrapper" on the image.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Changed the code to use set_post_thumbnail() and delete_post_thumbnail().
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'm a -0 on this, and had considered it when working on my patch. Using those methods introduces extra work (more get_post calls) that isn't required and introduces a layer of indirection that isn't particularly helpful.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Technically "_thumbnail_id" might be an internal/subject-to-change detail, but it's used in many places in core, and I see no reason why the XML-RPC server implementation can't use it too. If core were to ever change the implementation, they'd have to grep the codebase and they'd find its usage here and change it appropriately.
&lt;/p&gt;

Hey guys it's come a long way!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;TRUNK VERSION&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The links work and I'm finding they persist well when switching back and forth between HTML and Visual. It's great that the caption can be edited in the Visual editor and in the popup.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One thing I noticed is it strips out any use of &lt;code&gt;title=&lt;/code&gt; in links. Is that intentional/desirable? Link titles are important for accessibility as well as for SEO, if there's one attribute we should keep other than href it's probably title.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It's nice that if you type double quotes for caption links in the HTML editor then switching to VIsual editor makes them single quotes, but is there a way we could also do the same thing for people who only use the HTML editor? Right now saving the posts keeps the broken double-quotes-inside-double-quotes format and previewing it just makes the caption dissapear. It would be nice if people were protected from themselves even if they only use the HTML editor.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We aren't planning to stick with the "Add link" UI that's in trunk right now are we? I'm a bit confused but it sounds like Sushkov's patches to add quicktags is the right way to go.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;PATCH VERSION&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Unfortunately I can't seem to get the 18311_qtags_ui.4.diff patch to work. It patches successfully, but the result is very broken. In the uploader popup I can see a loose textarea at the bottom of the popup with the quicktags above it but looking unstyled.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Is there another patch from above that I need to get it working with trunk?
&lt;/p&gt;

The asterisks are special only at the beginning and the end of the search term.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For further questions, source code is your friend:
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
thanks a lot! makes sense why they would be disabled. also just curious, would you need to escape an asterisk if that was part of the search term? like \*sand\*
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Changed the code to use set_post_thumbnail() and delete_post_thumbnail().
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Couldn't change the get method because of not available when the theme doesn't have post thumbnail support.
Is it possible to move get_post_thumbnail_id() from /wp-includes/post-thumbnail-template.php to /wp-includes/post.php to make this happen?
&lt;/p&gt;

Well, the table layout is not going to change, so that's that. You might consider using Pods or some other plugin which uses custom tables.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In general, when you find yourself doing a lot of IN queries on meta, consider using a taxonomy instead.
&lt;/p&gt;

I'm not a MySQL expert, but someone said on the stackoverflow question that that might not help (&lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8893160/mysql-wordpress-slow-query-when-using-in-statements/8893207#comment11120031_8893207"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8893160/mysql-wordpress-slow-query-when-using-in-statements/8893207#comment11120031_8893207&lt;/a&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I tested out creating a 10 character index, and I didn't see any impact on performance in my particular case.

For performance reasons, wildcards are disabled by default. You have to pass &lt;code&gt;'*sand*'&lt;/code&gt; to enable them.

OP here ( &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/wp_user_query-search-bug?replies=1"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://wordpress.org/support/topic/wp_user_query-search-bug?replies=1&lt;/a&gt; ), before i knew i could submit tickets to WP's trac.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
for example I run
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$query = new WP_User_Query( array( 'search' =&amp;gt; 'sand' ) );
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
and get no results returned unless I set 'sand' to the exact match, like 'sandbox' (in my case).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
var_dump below. Specifically looking at the 'query_where', where it should be user_login LIKE '%sand%' with the ampersands to actually query LIKE terms.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;object(WP_User_Query)#5 (8) {
  ["results"]=&amp;gt;
  array(0) {
  }
  ["total_users"]=&amp;gt;
  string(1) "0"

  ["query_where"]=&amp;gt;
  string(67) "WHERE 1=1 AND (user_login LIKE 'sand' OR user_nicename LIKE 'sand')"
  ["query_orderby"]=&amp;gt;
  string(23) "ORDER BY user_login ASC"
  ["query_limit"]=&amp;gt;
  NULL
  ["query_vars"]=&amp;gt;
  array(15) {
    ["blog_id"]=&amp;gt;
    int(1)
    ["role"]=&amp;gt;
    string(0) ""

      <description>fixed: &lt;p&gt;
In &lt;a class="changeset" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/20029" title="Introduce WP_Theme, wp_get_themes(), and wp_get_theme() to replace ..."&gt;[20029]&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="message"&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Introduce WP_Theme, wp_get_themes(), and wp_get_theme() to replace get_themes(), get_theme(), get_theme_data(), current_theme_info(), and others.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Getters and Helpers: Introduces a series of methods to allow for easy generation of headers for display, and other theme metadata, including page templates.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Screenshots: Handles support for multiple screenshots. (see # Additional screenshots must be PNG and start with screenshot-2.png, and be sequential to be counted. see &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/19816" title="#19816: enhancement: Theme details should be able to include multiple screenshots (closed: duplicate)"&gt;#19816&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Error Handling: Broken themes have a WP_Error object attached to them.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Caching: Introduces a wp_cache_themes_persistently filter (also in &lt;a class="changeset" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/20020" title="Rewrite search_theme_directories() -- better performance and allow for ..."&gt;[20020]&lt;/a&gt;) to enable persistent caching of all filesystem and sanitization operations normally handled by WP_Theme (and formerly get_file_data() and get_themes()). Themes are cached individually and across five different cache keys for different data pieces.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Compatibility: A WP_Theme object is backwards compatible with a theme's array formerly returned by get_themes() and get_theme(), and an stdClass object formerly returned by current_theme_info().
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;i18n/L10n: Theme headers are now localizable with proper Text Domain and Domain Path headers, like plugins. (Language packs may remove the requirement for headers.) For page templates, see &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6007" title="#6007: enhancement: Template Name et al not localizable (closed: fixed)"&gt;#6007&lt;/a&gt; (not fixed yet, but will be easy now).

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;PHP and CSS files: New methods that fetch a list of theme files (for the theme editor) only on demand, rather than only loading them into memory. fixes &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/11214" title="#11214: enhancement: Improve get_themes() so that the size of the in-memory data is smaller (closed: fixed)"&gt;#11214&lt;/a&gt;.

Functions deprecated:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;get_theme() and current_theme_info() -- use wp_get_theme()

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
The only thing we can do here is add an index to the meta_value column.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since meta_value is of type LONGTEXT, the index needs to be limited to a certain length, which is up for debate.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I have noticed that when I have several criterion on a WP_Query meta query it can start to drastically impact performance. I don't know if this is just an unavoidable consequence of using the key/value data structure that WordPress does, but I wanted to bring it to the dev's attention now as it seems like 3.4 is going to involve some serious work on the Query component.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I have outlined a specific example of the problem in some detail here: &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/8893160/931860"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://stackoverflow.com/q/8893160/931860&lt;/a&gt;, and I can definitely provide more details if someone feels they would be relevant.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
This patch includes everything from the previous wp-reg-notify-option-patch.diff patch but also adds an option for controlling whether or not admins want to be notified of password resets.

Just use plain comparison operators: &amp;lt;, &amp;gt;, =, as in the uasort example: &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://php.net/uasort#example-4584"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://php.net/uasort#example-4584&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;i&gt;Type&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Severity&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
You should make a single patch that combines &lt;code&gt;themes.php.display_header_text.rev2.diff&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;custom-header.php.display_header_text.diff&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Also, &lt;code&gt;{1-2 words}.{ticket number}.diff&lt;/code&gt; is a suficiently descriptive patch name.
&lt;/p&gt;

One question: in _compare_imagedata_sizes(), why is strnatcmp() used to compare the dimensions (which are just numbers)?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Not sure? Probably because it worked, and I wasn't aware of a better method? :) I can change it though. Suggestions?

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Just some food for thought...
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Looking at how sections and settings are added in the &lt;code&gt;WP_Customize&lt;/code&gt; class, wouldn't there be a benefit to add a filter to &lt;code&gt;add_setting&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;add_section&lt;/code&gt;. This provides ample opportunity to filter (modify) the respective setting or sections, without having to resort to a later &lt;code&gt;remove_setting&lt;/code&gt;?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And this simply nitpicking: Sections and settings are rendered in the order it is saved in their respective arrays (in &lt;code&gt;WP_Customize&lt;/code&gt;). Since these are protected, no outside reference is given so the order cannot be changed (nor is there the ability to do so in &lt;code&gt;add_setting&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;add_section&lt;/code&gt;). This would be helpful to move certain sections or settings up and down the list for specific theme customizations (ie., a "Footer" right after the "Header" section, as "Static Front Page" and "Set Title &amp;amp; Tagline" would have little to do with it - makes it a bit more intuitive for the end-user.
&lt;/p&gt;

For simple things like this, when it is closed on a milestone that is not yet completed, this is fine.

Assuming Matt, Lance, and Drew don't object to it being a default for other reasons, we can easily code it to be a default except for in non-supported languages.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yep, let's shoot for that. A quick check of the language and load the necessary language sets on demand—instead of loading *all* sets for everyone.
&lt;/p&gt;

Assuming Matt, Lance, and Drew don't object to it being a default for other reasons, we can easily code it to be a default except for in non-supported languages.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'd be on board, but we'd also have to consider setting the appropriate character sets based on the language. Otherwise those users would be required to manually choose a character set, and have a broken experience by default. I'm not familiar with the nitty gritty on how that would all work, but if you're confident it would be comprehensive, I'm all for it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Loading all character sets by default would be another option, but that's adding a bunch of extra bloat and decreasing page load time for everyone, which I don't think is a good idea.
&lt;/p&gt;

The new logo is 5px shorter and 14px wider! The &lt;code&gt; readme.html &lt;/code&gt; file squished it up to 250x68. I propose to remove the inline attributes. Will check all instances of &lt;code&gt; wordpress-logo.png &lt;/code&gt; shortly, may not fit nicely somewhere else as well.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Testing it now.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Notes:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Check the 13774.3.diff before commit. There's two sections of debug code that needs to be removed first. Both are marked with TODO's.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Works for pre-existing parent themes (mazeld depends on twenty-ten):
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;Downloading install package from http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/download/mazeld.1.0.zip…
Unpacking the package…
Installing the theme…
This theme requires a parent theme, Checking if twentyten is installed…
The Parent theme, Twenty Ten 1.3, is currently installed.
Successfully installed the theme Mazeld 1.0.
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Works for children that don't have a parent installed (multi depends on desk-mess-mirrored):
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;Downloading install package from http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/download/multi.1.8.3.zip…
Unpacking the package…
Installing the theme…
This theme requires a parent theme, Checking if desk-mess-mirrored is installed…
Preparing to install Desk Mess Mirrored 2.0.1…
Downloading install package from http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/download/desk-mess-mirrored.2.0.1.zip…
Unpacking the package…
Installing the theme…
Successfully installed the parent theme Desk Mess Mirrored 2.0.1.
Successfully installed the theme Multi 1.8.3.
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Works for both cases in direct mode.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Works for both cases when forcing FTP mode (ftpsockets). Note, tested on localhost, so PHP timeouts not a problem in this case. But nothing much that can be done about that anyway.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;FTP Filesystem finder works correctly to find the right directories on a multi-single-site install in FTP mode. Tested with 8 subdirectory WP installs on localhost and the FTP directory pointing at the htdocs root (so it can see them all).
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Looks good to me. Remove the debug lines and should be good to go. UI details can be adjusted later if needed.
&lt;/p&gt;

The reason we're leaving it off by default is for RTL and non-supported languages. Otherwise, those users would have a broken default experience.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I can't add tags to post with diacritical marks (for example polish word "bąk") and then the same word without diacritical marks "bak" from edit post panel, because function term_exists() in wp-includes\taxonomy.php returns true when checking if this tag already exists. I can do this from tag edit panel, but this is more time concuming.

&lt;p&gt;
Sorry, I didn't have all the facts. The font is not packaged with the theme. It links directly from Google Web Fonts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That means we can approve themes that use non-GPL fonts linked from Google Web Fonts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If it's not bundled with the Theme, then there is no licensing issue whatsoever.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think Matt's suggestion (via Lance's comment) is a perfectly sane approach (though I don't know why it would need to be disabled by default?).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;get_theme_root()&lt;/strong&gt; considers a theme root returned from get_raw_theme_root() to be an absolute path if it is a registered theme directory. This provides a big of wiggle room for a situation where the current theme is ABSPATH but not WP_CONTENT_DIR, or in WP_PLUGIN_DIR in a situation where that is not in WP_CONTENT_DIR.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;get_theme_root_uri()&lt;/strong&gt; makes the same considerations as get_theme_root(), taking it a step further and attempts to find the right URL when we're not in WP_CONTENT_DIR. It is occasionally even successful.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cleans up the branching in register_theme_directory().

&lt;strong&gt;Font issue update:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Matt gave us his approval for using Open Sans in the default theme, as long as it’s a theme option—off by default—and not bundled directly with the theme.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I’m fine with having an option to turn on linked google fonts
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don’t think the license of the font being apache 2 is a minus — the options for fonts aren’t great and that’s probably more efficient than GPL
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
for a font you really want something like LGPL or apache so you don't get into anything weird with licensing of documents / things created with the font
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The bottom line is since the font will be off by default the theme should still look great without it.
&lt;/p&gt;

Sorry, I didn't have all the facts. The font is not packaged with the theme. It links directly from Google Web Fonts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That means we can approve themes that use non-GPL fonts linked from Google Web Fonts.
&lt;/p&gt;

So that font needs to be removed/changed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We won't be releasing any theme with a non-GPLv2 font, so yes.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I redid my changes after a bunch of testing on WP.com, with themes that do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have a custom comment callback.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The patch now is back to simply improving code quality, and only adding in classes and markup, not changing existing markup and styles.
&lt;/p&gt;

ocean90's difficulties were a result of &lt;a class="changeset" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/20001" title="Always return an absolute path in get_raw_theme_root() and ..."&gt;r20001&lt;/a&gt;.

Once we have an idea there for how to proceed, &lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/20103/20103.3.diff" title="Attachment '20103.3.diff' in Ticket #20103"&gt;20103.3.diff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/20103/20103.3.diff" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt; will land.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Given the universal (in WordPress) usage of stylesheet to refer to a particular theme directory (and not necessarily CSS files), we're not going to change it to style_sheet.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;i&gt;Cc&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
On the naming issue, could we fix the non-existent word "stylesheet"? It has, and always was two words, as per the CSS abbreviation, and the names on the corresponding W3C documents.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After a very quick look through the patch, I see &lt;code&gt;$stylesheet&lt;/code&gt; only as a private property, or as the argument names / variables inside functions, so they could be switched to &lt;code&gt;$style_sheet&lt;/code&gt; without fuss.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Any standalone function like &lt;code&gt;get_stylesheet()&lt;/code&gt; that remains after scribu has had his suggestion of renaming them, could stay as it was, but the methods introduced in the class could be renamed as &lt;code&gt;get_style_sheet()&lt;/code&gt;. Obviously &lt;code&gt;Stylesheet&lt;/code&gt; array keys would stay as they are too, unless you wanted to allow both versions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I suspect the suggestion will be disregarded on grounds of introducing inconsistency, but since you're re-writing a hefty chunk of the internals, now is the most opportune moment to suggest improvements to the internals to match the naming conventions in the coding standards.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I made this worse with &lt;a class="changeset" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/20001" title="Always return an absolute path in get_raw_theme_root() and ..."&gt;[20001]&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Due to work in &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/20103" title="#20103: defect (bug): Rewrite get_themes() and other enemies of sanity (closed: fixed)"&gt;#20103&lt;/a&gt; and due to my familiarity with the return value of search_theme_directories(), I missed that the theme_roots transient was actually relative to WP_CONTENT_DIR. Therefore it is not only possible for one to have a relative path in their template_root and stylesheet_root (which I did not think was possible), but it is the only situation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Paths relative to WP_CONTENT_DIR are going to be much nicer to work with, and they are portable. But we still need absolute paths somewhere.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I am trying to come up with a solution here, but I am not sure what it will be yet. One option is that we try to store a relative path (strip out WP_CONTENT_DIR if we find it), and then when we pull that data, if the path is not in $wp_theme_directories, but WP_CONTENT_DIR + path is, it's pretty easy to assume it is relative.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This keeps the database relatively clear, the theme_roots transient free of repetitive absolute paths (much less data being stored), and doesn't hurt &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/20103" title="#20103: defect (bug): Rewrite get_themes() and other enemies of sanity (closed: fixed)"&gt;#20103&lt;/a&gt; too much.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
When a theme uses a body background image and we change the background image from custom background menu, it works beautifully. But if we do not set the background and change the color only, it doesn't replace the theme's background image. A fix would be to add
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
background-image: none;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
if there is no background image in the custom background page. Can this be fixed? I am having an issue with this since my theme uses background image by default in the body tag..
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
The W3C document that WP CS guideline was written 12 years ago - I've been trying to find out a definitive list of the "older browsers" are that everyone refers to when saying the space is needed for their compatibility.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If, as some say, it's for Netscape Navigator (4), and earlier, then the space could probably be dropped.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I've even tweeted at Hixie and Eliot Graff (author of the HTML-XHTML Polyglot document to see if they have a list.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think it may end up with finding someone with an afternoon free who can install old versions of all the browsers and a simple test page to determine which browsers don't display &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; correctly.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
One reason I would disable &lt;code&gt;wpLink&lt;/code&gt; in image popus, is because wpLink itself is a popup.
While its OK to have it inside single &lt;code&gt;media.php&lt;/code&gt; item pages, in editor it results in some sort of &lt;code&gt;Inception&lt;/code&gt; movie...
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Static &lt;code&gt;wpeditimage.html&lt;/code&gt; needs a bunch of js files in header to make it work, and a valid &lt;code&gt;tinyMCEPopup&lt;/code&gt; object.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
UI/UX feedback is welcome, please.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I have two issues with the class:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Theme editor can't find the theme – "The requested theme does not exist."
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;themes.php: The current theme display is broken: &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://cl.ly/EaoG"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://cl.ly/EaoG&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Also the patch doesn't apply cleanly anymore.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Pretty nice class and +1 for translatable theme headers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
@Nacin: Some Questions...
&lt;em&gt;I only briefly looked over the code&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Couldn't - inside &lt;code&gt;function offsetGet( $offset )&lt;/code&gt; - the default be set to &lt;code&gt;return $this-&amp;gt;display( $offset );&lt;/code&gt; (instead of &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;), so we'd have the ability to add (for e.g.) &lt;code&gt;DataBaseVersion&lt;/code&gt; to the header (we still have no update/upgrade hook for themes)?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Extending the switch for Author &amp;amp; Description inside &lt;code&gt;function sanitize_header( $header, $value )&lt;/code&gt; - &lt;code&gt;wp_kses()&lt;/code&gt; with the allowed tags of &lt;code&gt;cite&lt;/code&gt; for addresses and &lt;code&gt;strike&lt;/code&gt; for update notes wouldn't hurt. I'd also love to see &lt;code&gt;sub/sup&lt;/code&gt; and maybe even &lt;code&gt;u&lt;/code&gt; be available.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For cases similar to &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9411612/wordpress-hiding-or-removing-parent-themes-templates/9413609"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;this one (filtering page templates)&lt;/a&gt; it would be nice to have a filter for the returned list of themes. Currently it's only in use to build the templates drop-down for the post edit/new screen.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</description>

      <title>Ticket #19925 (Empty widget title in admin not handled properly) updated</title>
      
        <dc:creator>kawauso</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Tue, 28 Feb 2012 09:36:42 GMT</pubDate>

      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/19925#comment:2/1330421802923238</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Replying to &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/19925#comment:1" title="Comment 1"&gt;mp3j3rk&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Before patching, after a refresh, or navigating away from the page and then back to it, the name updates.  Obviously, we would like to see the widget's title update immediately after clicking Save.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That's rather odd. It should be being updated along with the widget saving spinner in either case. Perhaps there's a JS conflict on your site or JS is disabled?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
why did you use
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;if (typeof title != "undefined")&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
instead of something like
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;if (typeof title == "undefined" || title === null || title === '')&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The initial
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;if ( title = title.val() )&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
will be true for any case where &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt; is a non-empty string, so
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;if (typeof title != "undefined")&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
just sorts between the two other potential values returned by &lt;code&gt;jQuery.val()&lt;/code&gt;, an empty string and an undefined value when there is no title field. In the latter case, we don't want to touch the title at all since there is no title value to display (rather than an empty one).
&lt;/p&gt;

Patch attached, lots of red. This will probably break plugins that were using those options. A &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=links_recently_updated_time+site%3Aplugins.svn.wordpress.org"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;quick search&lt;/a&gt; says there are very few, although this isn't necessarily a good enough reason to drop them.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
The brand new navigation.js in twentytwelve fails to use the cached $("#masthead') jQuery collection properly. It's attempting to wrap an already cached jQuery collection inside a new jQuery object several times (which works, because jQuery anticipated this incorrect usage). This patch fixes that.
&lt;/p&gt;

The links table has a column called &lt;code&gt;link_updated&lt;/code&gt; which used to be used to store the date the link last changed (using pingomatic to check for this).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The link update checking was removed from core some time ago, see &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12437" title="#12437: defect (bug): Remove Options -&amp;gt; Miscellaneous (closed: fixed)"&gt;#12437&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="changeset" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/13744" title="Remove the now defunct link update checker from core.

However there's still some code in &lt;code&gt;wp-admin/bookmark.php&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;wp-admin/bookmark-template.php&lt;/code&gt; which uses &lt;code&gt;link_updated&lt;/code&gt; as well as the &lt;code&gt;links_recently_updated_time&lt;/code&gt; option. I guess the column in the database can't just be dropped because of back compat. But the code that uses it in core looks like it can.

      <description>&lt;i&gt;Keywords&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Can you post a code example showing actual vs expected output? From what I can see, the function already returns an array of category IDs, which seems to be what you want:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;array (
  'link_id' =&amp;gt; 1,
  'link_url' =&amp;gt; 'http://codex.wordpress.org/',
  'link_name' =&amp;gt; 'Documentation',
  'link_image' =&amp;gt; '',
  'link_target' =&amp;gt; '',
  'link_description' =&amp;gt; '',
  'link_visible' =&amp;gt; 'Y',
  'link_owner' =&amp;gt; '1',
  'link_rating' =&amp;gt; 0,
  'link_updated' =&amp;gt; '0000-00-00 00:00:00',
  'link_rel' =&amp;gt; '',
  'link_notes' =&amp;gt; '',
  'link_rss' =&amp;gt; '',
  'link_category' =&amp;gt;
  array (
    0 =&amp;gt; 2,
    1 =&amp;gt; 12,
    2 =&amp;gt; 15
  ),
)

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
First off, I'm still new, so I could be completely off-base here.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Before patching, after a refresh, or navigating away from the page and then back to it, the name updates.  Obviously, we would like to see the widget's title update immediately after clicking Save.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After applying the patch, I did not see any change to the behavior.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I do have a question, on line 256 of the patched file, why did you use
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;if (typeof title != "undefined")&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
instead of something like
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;if (typeof title == "undefined" || title === null || title === '')&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
?

      <title>Ticket #20129 (get_bookmark object should return array of categories) created</title>
      
        <dc:creator>andrewheins</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Tue, 28 Feb 2012 02:17:31 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/20129</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/20129/1330395451625457</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
get_bookmark() returns a bookmark object with a single taxonomy and term_id, which are returned as strings.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the WordPress admin section, it's possible to select multiple categories for a link (or bookmark, as it were).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
get_bookmark() currently pulls all bookmarks for the categories you choose, and then runs array_unique on them to weed out duplicates. You only wind up with whatever the first category it pulled from.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It would be more consistent to merge those duplicate links, creating an array of term_ids for that bookmark, and allowing the developer to pull all of the terms for that bookmark.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Ok, here's my feeble attempt at providing a solution that will catch any type of value submitted via $extra_fields and parse it correctly within the input field. Because my knowledge of recursion is shoddy at best, I came up with this function instead.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All it does is sanitize and store all the data passed via $extra_fields into an array and then builds a query string based on that data. Then I just run through the query string and make input fields.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It works in all my testing. I don't know if this is the -best- method, but it is a -working- method that can at least get the ball rolling so that no data is lost when attempting to pass it once the user hits "Proceed".
&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Tue, 28 Feb 2012 01:24:44 GMT</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/17597/get_raw_theme_root.diff" title="Attachment 'get_raw_theme_root.diff' in Ticket #17597"&gt;get_raw_theme_root.diff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/17597/get_raw_theme_root.diff" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt; should fix this.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This changes the return value of get_raw_theme_root() in some cases., for it to always be absolute. I am not concerned. One, there are no plugins using get_raw_theme_root() in the directory. Two, it is such an edge function, that if you were using it, you were surely playing with multiple theme roots, and therefore would have noticed the discrepancy in the return value such that you worked around it, perhaps by looking for '/themes' and prepending WP_CONTENT_DIR.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This also fixes the return value of get_theme_roots() by making it absolute when only one directory is registered. I am not concerned for the same reason as above. It also now returns in this case get_theme_root(), rather than WP_CONTENT_DIR . /themes, because get_theme_root() is a filtered version of that, and that is what we pass to register_theme_directory() to register the initial theme root. However, WP_CONTENT_DIR . '/themes' is still used in get_raw_theme_root() as that is designed to be raw and unfiltered.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The code for grabbing a theme root URI is still lame (it strips out WP_CONTENT_DIR then passes it to content_url()), but this is no less lame than it is in get_themes() or even WP_Theme.
&lt;/p&gt;

Related tickets I could find:

The patch here tries to fix this but not correctly. Coming up with a better solution.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16744" title="#16744: defect (bug): Theme editor doesn't work on child themes whose parents have a custom ... (closed: fixed)"&gt;#16744&lt;/a&gt;, theme editor does not work when the parent theme is in a different theme root. Should be easy to fix with WP_Theme.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10067" title="#10067: enhancement: add theme_basename(), and make sure it plays well with get_theme_root() (closed: duplicate)"&gt;#10067&lt;/a&gt; (closed as duplicate), theme_basename() function.

Sorry, I wasn't aware of the history there. Yes, WP_PLUGIN_DIR can be outside of WP_CONTENT_DIR. It probably shouldn't be, but it can be. I will run some tests after &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/20103" title="#20103: defect (bug): Rewrite get_themes() and other enemies of sanity (closed: fixed)"&gt;#20103&lt;/a&gt; drops.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Best to leave it alone and just avoid introducing new calls to these functions from now on.

register_theme_directory() is only supposed to work within WP_CONTENT_DIR.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'm fine with that, but then we should make it clear and remove the bits from &lt;a class="changeset" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/12043" title="Restore the functionality of the theme_root filter. See #10467."&gt;[12043]&lt;/a&gt;.

register_theme_directory() is only supposed to work within WP_CONTENT_DIR. Supporting it outside of WP_CONTENT_DIR could happen I suppose, but definitely not before &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/20103" title="#20103: defect (bug): Rewrite get_themes() and other enemies of sanity (closed: fixed)"&gt;#20103&lt;/a&gt; settles. Unfortunately the theme root API is a bit kludgy and only lightly used. (&lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/20103" title="#20103: defect (bug): Rewrite get_themes() and other enemies of sanity (closed: fixed)"&gt;#20103&lt;/a&gt; includes a fix for a rather annoying bug, for example, to get_raw_theme_root().)

I actually looked at the patch now. It implements ArrayAccess and everything!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We can figure out the naming after the initial commit.
&lt;/p&gt;

Could we take this opportunity to find better names for get_template() / get_stylesheet() and co.?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We could indeed! It was just not a priority during the construction. And, for my sanity, it was easiest to code it in the existing paradigm.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;i&gt;Milestone&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/20103/wp_theme.diff" title="Attachment 'wp_theme.diff' in Ticket #20103"&gt;wp_theme.diff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/20103/wp_theme.diff" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="IntroducingtheWP_Themeclass"&gt;Introducing the WP_Theme class&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As the ticket promises, WP_Theme replaces get_themes() and other enemies of sanity. Each theme is its own object, decorated on construction and packed with 21 main public methods, four public static methods, and a few internal helpers. Full support for multiple theme roots and directories of themes within a theme root. The handling for broken-ness and odd situations is smoother than get_themes().
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;array wp_get_themes( $args = array() );
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
To fetch a array of WP_Theme objects, call wp_get_themes(). wp_get_themes( $args ) takes three arguments that filter the results: errors, allowed, and blog_id.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;errors&lt;/strong&gt; (Default: FALSE) - Filters themes based on whether they have errors. True returns only themes with errors, False only themes without errors, Null if all themes should be returned.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;allowed&lt;/strong&gt; (Default: NULL) - Filters themes based on whether they are allowed on the site or network. (Multisite only.) Valid options are 'network' (allowed on the network), 'site' (allowed on the site specified by the blog_id argument), true (allowed at either level), false (not allowed).
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;blog_id&lt;/strong&gt; (Default: current) - Controls which site should be checked for the allowed filter. Only works, of course, in multisite.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;WP_Theme wp_get_theme( $stylesheet = null, $theme_root = null );
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
To fetch a single theme, call wp_get_theme(). This will return a single WP_Theme object for the requested theme.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It takes two argumements: $stylesheet and $theme_root. If $stylesheet is omitted, the current stylesheet (via get_stylesheet()) will be used. If the $theme_root is omitted, get_raw_theme_root($stylesheet) will be used. Thus, to get the current theme, you may call wp_get_theme() with no arguments.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
wp_get_theme() replaces get_theme(). get_theme() previously used get_current_theme() to get the name-keyed theme array from get_themes(). Not only are we no longer juggling arrays keyed by the theme name, we're not even processing every theme into memory to get a single WP_Theme object. Nice.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HandlingErrors"&gt;Handling Errors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Currently, search_theme_directories() and get_themes() will build a separate array of broken themes, $wp_broken_themes. This array is then returned by get_broken_themes().
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With WP_Theme, errors like no template, invalid parent themes, or unreadable stylesheets can be nicely caught. Errors are populated into an errors property, accessible via WP_Theme-&amp;gt;errors(). It is either null or no errors, or a WP_Error object. wp_get_themes( array( 'errors' =&amp;gt; true ) ) enables one to loop through and pull out error messages and codes from a WP_Error object. In some cases, the current theme could 'error' but it still works, and we have access to what went wrong.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NetworkSupport"&gt;Network Support&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
WP_Theme encapsulates the logic for allowed themes on a network, with static methods to fetch all allowed themes on a network, themes allowed at the site level, and a merge of both lists (all themes allowed for a single site).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Each theme object then has a simple is_allowed( $check = 'both', $blog_id = 0 ) method to allow for checking whether it is allowed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The okay-named function get_site_allowed_themes() and the terribly named function wpmu_get_blog_allowedthemes() are both deprecated in favor of static class methods.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OutputtingHeaders"&gt;Outputting Headers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What started me on WP_Theme was that get_themes() could not be internationalized in any sane way (&lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/15858" title="#15858: defect (bug): Twenty Ten i18n - translated strings not visible (closed: fixed)"&gt;#15858&lt;/a&gt;). The data usually came out of get_theme_data() already cleaned and even marked up (such as with wptexturize), making translation difficult or impossible. Since the data was keyed by name, changing that value would break quite a bit. As get_themes() already stored a lot of data in memory (and blows up memcached on WP.com, as they try to store it persistently), adding more keys didn't make sense.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;mixed WP_Theme-&amp;gt;get( $header )
mixed WP_Theme-&amp;gt;display( $header, $markup = true, $translate = true )
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
WP_Theme has two main method for gathering header data: get() and display(). Once you call get(), the data has already been sanitized, either by strip_tags(), kses, or esc_url, depending on the header. (Tags are returned as an array.) By calling display(), the data is translated, and then marked up. (Even Tags — the array is translated for known tags.) The textdomain is automatically loaded if necessary.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
display() returns data. It does not echo it. It is formatting the data for display, and would roughly be analogous to get_bloginfo( 'name', 'display' ).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
get('Author') returns Andrew Nacin. display('Author') marks that up with &amp;lt;a&amp;gt; tags and a link to &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://nacin.com"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://nacin.com&lt;/a&gt; (being AuthorURI).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
display() also allows you to decline markup and translation with additional arguments, but these are mainly used for backwards compatibility or to allow fields to be searched through without Author HTML and the like.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Private methods sanitize_header(), translate_header(), and markup_header() support get() and display() in their endeavors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Helpers"&gt;Helpers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
WP_Theme has a number of public methods that corresponds to the global function acting on the active theme. These include:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;bool   WP_Theme-&amp;gt;is_child_theme()
string WP_Theme-&amp;gt;get_stylesheet()
string WP_Theme-&amp;gt;get_template()
string WP_Theme-&amp;gt;get_stylesheet_directory()
string WP_Theme-&amp;gt;get_template_directory()
string WP_Theme-&amp;gt;get_stylesheet_directory_uri()
string WP_Theme-&amp;gt;get_template_directory_uri()
string WP_Theme-&amp;gt;get_theme_root()
string WP_Theme-&amp;gt;get_theme_root_uri()
bool   WP_Theme-&amp;gt;load_textdomain()
array  WP_Theme-&amp;gt;get_page_templates()
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In some cases (notably, get_page_templates()), the global function now wraps the method.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Screenshots"&gt;Screenshots&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;string function get_screenshot( $uri = 'relative' )
int    function get_screenshot_count()
array  function get_screenshots()
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
3.4 means multiple screenshots. WP_Theme has you covered. Three public methods provide the screenshot URL (absolute URL, or relative to the stylesheet directory), the total count of screenshots, and an array of each screenshot filename.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TemplateandStylesheetFiles"&gt;Template and Stylesheet Files&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;array WP_Theme-&amp;gt;get_files( $type = null )
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
get_themes() stored the template and stylesheet files in the array, which resulted in longer processing times and, especially since absolute paths were added in 2.9, an explosion in memory usage.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
WP_Theme handles traversing the PHP and CSS files theme directories &lt;em&gt;on demand&lt;/em&gt;. As these are only used in the theme editor (and only for the current theme), this is a pretty huge performance and memory boost.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FullBackwardsCompatibility"&gt;Full Backwards Compatibility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
WP_Theme is 100% backwards compatible. Because it implements ArrayAccess, you can take a theme object and look for keys like 'Template Files', 'Stylesheet', and 'Version' — just as they were returned by get_themes(). WP_Theme also includes a magic getter, handling all properties that were returned by current_theme_info() (which returned stdClass in 3.3). This enables us to pass a fully decorated WP_Theme object as an existing action argument, without plugins choking because they expected an array or an older object.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Indeed, get_themes() now returns an array of WP_Theme objects, because it can. get_theme() returns a WP_Theme object, as does current_theme_info(). (All are deprecated, as is get_broken_themes().)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you don't believe me on backwards compatibility, head over to the Theme Editor, which passes around theme names like they're crack. This file is the only area that hasn't been updated to rely on WP_Theme; it still uses get_themes() and the array it returns for each theme. Everything works.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TheParentTheme"&gt;The Parent Theme&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A reference to a WP_Theme object for a parent theme is stored in the parent property, and accessible with the parent() method. Want a theme's parent name? $theme-&amp;gt;parent() &amp;amp;&amp;amp; $theme-&amp;gt;parent()-&amp;gt;display('Name').
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CachingandPerformance"&gt;Caching and Performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Okay, so, this is sweet. After profiling get_themes() and WP_Theme with Xdebug and KCacheGrind, a few functions have been sped up, in some cases pretty significantly. This includes search_theme_directories() and theme searching, which was a drag for no real reason. Searching is now improved significantly, and is implemented as a class method to allow for better speeds. (Now that things are "ready," I hope to go back and look for further improvements.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Once sorting was fixed, two things stood out as weighing down processing the most: Filesystem reads, and sanitization of headers. With WP_Theme, both are non-persistently cached, internally, to ensure serious speed. No style.css is ever read twice, and no header is ever sanitized twice. Same goes for identifying screenshots and PHP/CSS files — everything gets cached.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Non-persistence is a must for themes because someone might make an FTP change then refresh the page. BUT, that doesn't mean a particular installation shouldn't be able to opt into persistence.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When the themes cache bucket is persistent (there's a filter), WP_Theme gets smart about it. To prevent thousands of cache sets to update the headers cache, it sanitizes every header once the first one is requested and adds it to cache. Additionally, search_theme_directories() is cached.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With persistent caching, it is possible to hit themes.php, and even do a search, and avoid a single filesystem or kses operation. The 150-something themes in the WP.com themes repository sings in this situation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="WhatsNext"&gt;What's Next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Commit this bad boy.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol start="2"&gt;&lt;li&gt;If object cache drop-ins had a wp_cache_get_non_persistent_groups() function, we could scrap that filter and make it much cleaner. (It's a rough implementation and could use some tweaks anyway.)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol start="3"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some of the filesystem functions — specifically, the underlying scandir() static method and get_files() — don't quite have their arguments or loops ironed out yet. Once the theme editor is converted over, those things should come into place nicely. Code review appreciated.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</description>

Andrew, I hope this addresses a few of your questions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Why use a class for WP_Customize?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The WP_Customize class does not just include customize-controls.php. It also handles correctly previewing a theme (in both the admin and front-end), registering and maintaining sections and settings, and properly switching the theme and saving settings.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Why is this in wp-includes?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To preview a theme setting, we need to be able to override it on the front end; the code has to run there. On top of that, it would be fairly easy to alter the WP_Customize class to run completely independent of the admin (if we removed the final keyword, that is).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;What's going on in customize-base.js?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There is some underlying sugar there for several reasons. The most prominent is not fully operational yet, which is that there will be an option for the preview to apply changes without completely refreshing the page. This option will be facilitated by postMessage and synchronized values. Instead of writing code to individually watch, bind and synchronize each input, the sugar provides a system to keep all of them in sync with only a few lines of code.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It's important to note that this is JS-only UI. One of the main goals here is to make it easy for plugins and themes to add to the customize controls and preview without having to unbind large portions of core code.
&lt;/p&gt;

Replying to &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16434#comment:93" title="Comment 93"&gt;TomAuger&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Are you suggesting we only allow upload of 16 x 16 or 32 x 32 sized images, and don't allow for crop or resize?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Not exactly. Best probably would be to expect properly sized images. If the user uploads something above 32x32, it can be cropped and resized automatically and saved as .png (and .ico if possible). We need to allow uploading of favicons and properly include/link them, not make a tool for creating tham :)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I can see your arguments for this approach. However, all the images (photographic or otherwise) that I have used during the testing have turned out remarkably well...
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yes, many would turn well but many would fail too. It would be better if the user knows what the image looks like before uploading.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don't mind the idea of adding a "help" icon that would provide tips, or some contextual help on the General settings page...
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yes, I meant a tab in the contextual help, probably with a short sentence under the "Upload" button that will send the user there. We won't need to add a lot of text, only 1-2 sentences explaining that favicons are very small images and should be generated by software or on particular websites.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I believe that for the 80% we give them the ability to upload anything.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Right, but also tell them what a favicon is and how they can make a good looking one.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And for the 20%, let's make sure that if we do get an icon in 16x16 or 32x32, or if it's already in ico format, it doesn't get interpolated or otherwise mutilated.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Agree. If an .ico image is uploaded or if the image is already 32x32 we shouldn't touch it at all (don't think we can touch .ico in GD anyways).
&lt;/p&gt;

Replying to &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/20109#comment:1" title="Comment 1"&gt;duck_&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The rewrite bypass rules above were in the middle of .htaccess, before the WP index.php rules. Because all of the rules in the file refered to pages, not posts, the rules were all working, and are still working, converting incoming old urls to new page urls prior to hitting the WP index.php rules.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The behavior I was seeing was really bizarre, because the good and intended content is definitely being rendered, not an empty page and not the standard or custom 404 page. For the purpose of demonstrating this, I am putting just the areas rule above back into the .htaccess file of my 3.3.1 development environment, with no other url specific rules. So to see this behavior in action, go to: &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://dev1.denverhomevalue.com/areas/denver-central-communities.html"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://dev1.denverhomevalue.com/areas/denver-central-communities.html&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You will see the full and correct content for that page, but with a 404 header response. You should see the same kind of behavior on all pages under the "Metro Areas" menu category, but normal 200 responses to everything else in the other menu categories.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Really, regardless of what earlier release this affects, which my own experience and testing shows was not an issue in the production/stable version of 3.2.1 I was on, 3.3 actually renders proper content, while improperly returning a 404 header, and that to me is the root issue, regardless of whether the WP index.php rewrite rules are going to be hit or not. Essentially, if content is successfully rendered, as my dev1 site proves is happening, then 200 should be the response. Only if content cannot be successfully rendered should it invoke a 404 response, and that should also trigger the standard or custom 404 action for the site.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The complete .htaccess currently on the above dev site follows:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
&amp;lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&amp;gt;

Unless you're going to be the person who writes the code o fix this, you shouldn't be assigning it to yourself. The 'owned by' means thats who's owning the work to fix it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This works as expected for me, out of the box, on a vanilla WP site.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When added to the end of article eg. ?p=adasdasdas or ?p=2312312
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
?p= whatever is what's used for ugly permalinks, so if you're making up your own plugin to mess with that, I can see issues. I think you've got a theme or plugin issue going on, and should post for support in the forums.

Regarding &lt;code&gt;ob_start()&lt;/code&gt;, I would leave it for later. To be honest, I don't see any reason why buffers should be avoided...
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;ob_start()&lt;/code&gt; is "evil" :) We've had problems with it in the past, seems some hosts run custom handlers that do all sorts of things with the buffers.

&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The problem is that at such small sizes (16 x 16) most images don't look good. It doesn't matter if they are resized in PHP or by the browser on display.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Are you suggesting we only allow upload of 16 x 16 or 32 x 32 sized images, and don't allow for crop or resize?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I can see your arguments for this approach. However, all the images (photographic or otherwise) that I have used during the testing have turned out remarkably well. The most common things people will use would be their company logo, or a photo of themselves (ie: mugshot). Both of these would render quite decently with the antialias + interpolation settings that are currently in place in the resizing process.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don't mind the idea of adding a "help" icon that would provide tips, or some contextual help on the General settings page that talks about good favicons, but it seems to me that it's out of scope for us to include training about how to make your site look good inline or onboard. Otherwise one could argue that we get into a slippery slope where we're now advising on content, so should we also provide tips on how to make a good masthead or background image, or write a good post title?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I believe that for the 80% we give them the ability to upload anything. Worst case scenario, they have a custom ugly favicon instead of the default ugly favicon; more likely they will have a mediocre custom favicon of their face, or their kid, or their logo. If they're smart, they'll take the text out of their logo and just use the icon.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And for the 20%, let's make sure that if we do get an icon in 16x16 or 32x32, or if it's already in ico format, it doesn't get interpolated or otherwise mutilated. So designers can do it themselves with their Photoshop ICO plugin, or some online service.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Doing some research, it looks like ImageMagick supports creating ICO files. We should probably just use Imagick if it exists, and fallback to PNG-only if it does not...
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
+1. Also not sure if there should be any support for image manipulation after uploading. The problem is that at such small sizes (16 x 16) most images don't look good. It doesn't matter if they are resized in PHP or by the browser on display.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So an "unaware" user will not be able to add a decent looking favicon by uploading an arbitrary image. Imho it would be much better to include some help text about favicons in general and the requirement for using .ico format image for best browser compatibility. There are many ways a user can generate decent looking .ico file, including online image editing websites that handle exactly that.
&lt;/p&gt;

You snuck yourself in there before my patch was up, so you'll see that the ico2_3.php &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; included (and works fine). At this point we have a working (if somewhat blunt) favicon solution. What's next?

Would we consider releasing the next version with a &lt;em&gt;default&lt;/em&gt; WordPress favicon in place (possibly in the root directory) in .png and .ico format? A fallback for when you have not defined one yourself in Settings &amp;gt; General? This would also help with a lot of 404's that servers are getting.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
No, a few reasons: One, it is difficult to then go ahead and remove that file (otherwise, some browsers will still read it). Two, there's really no reason for a default WordPress favicon on every WP.org site out there. Three, it only works for root-level sites. Four, we already intercept root-level /favicon.ico requests early and return a zero-length image/vnd.microsoft.com response, so 404s are not going to end up being logged if external rewrite rules are in place to map everything to index.php. Some hosts have simply placed favicon.ico files in root directories to even prevent WordPress from loading in these cases, but I don't think that's our responsibility beyond what we already do.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I agree that supporting ICO should be the goal. Let's just not catch ourselves up over it. Still need to build a working feature. :-)
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
The only problem with only supporting PNG is that the entire Internet Explorer userbase would be alienated. This doesn't seem like the "WordPress Way" to me - rolling out a feature that just won't work for a popular browser.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I think our efforts are best spent aimed at getting the PNG upload process polished and squared away. If we can generate ICO files at a later point, woo, but that is not necessary for version 1.
&lt;/p&gt;

I'm not that familiar with licensing, so my question is maybe more about that - is it okay to modify the source code of that library? What is the downside of doing that?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
From a licensing perspective, yes. From a maintenance perspective, we try not to. And when we do, we carefully consider why, and even then, we try to float the patch upstream.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So you don't think it would be a problem to refactor that library / ie: alter the source code? (it could use some rehabilitation IMHO)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This library has seen better days. I would not be comfortable including it in core in its current state, unless it receives an audit, at the very least.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Doing some research, it looks like ImageMagick supports creating ICO files. We should probably just use Imagick if it exists, and fallback to PNG-only if it does not. Here's some stuff on php.net &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/imagick.flattenimages.php"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;on ICO to PNG&lt;/a&gt;, for example.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
The Filesystem API doesn't fit here. If we can't take an uploaded PNG and write out ICO, we use the PNG. This is the uploads directory — If we can upload the PNG, we can likely write the ICO to the same place. (The library *could* use an is_writeable() check, and/or some sort of error handling or suppression on the fopen(), but we can let it slide during testing.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The Filesystem API is only designed for critical tasks. Updates, installs. Things like uploads are not critical and therefore avoid the filesystem API. It's also why permissions are going to be more lax on the uploads directory in many cases, because we need to be able to write files here in a normal process, rather than asking for your FTP credentials. (Not even sure how that'd work anyway.)
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Hi.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don't know where these urls are being genereated but look:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;?paged=[random string/numbers]
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://blog.seo-profi.pl/?paged=dascas"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://blog.seo-profi.pl/?paged=dascas&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://blog.seo-profi.pl/?paged=2123312312"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://blog.seo-profi.pl/?paged=2123312312&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://wordpress.org/news/?paged=dalsdkalsdk"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://wordpress.org/news/?paged=dalsdkalsdk&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
shows index.php instead of 404.php -&amp;gt; generating multpile DC content which is not good for my seo sites.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start="2"&gt;&lt;li&gt;When added to the end of article eg. ?p=adasdasdas or ?p=2312312
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://blog.seo-profi.pl/wywiad-z-kasparem-szymanskim-guglarzem-luty-2012/?p=dasdaspdapspd"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://blog.seo-profi.pl/wywiad-z-kasparem-szymanskim-guglarzem-luty-2012/?p=dasdaspdapspd&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
it redirects me (301) to entire article (which is good) but works for me only after installing 'platinum seo pack'
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Unfortunatelly, when added to page permalink, situation from point 1 happens.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Look what is in google :
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://www.google.pl/search?q=site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fchaudesonline.com%2F&amp;amp;ie=utf-8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;aq=t&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla:pl:official&amp;amp;client=firefox-a#q=site:http://chaudesonline.com/&amp;amp;hl=pl&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;hs=buO&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla:pl:official&amp;amp;prmd=imvns&amp;amp;ei=lqpLT6bHDISZOrytyOMF&amp;amp;start=80&amp;amp;sa=N&amp;amp;fp=1&amp;amp;biw=1280&amp;amp;bih=888&amp;amp;cad=b&amp;amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.,cf.osb"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://www.google.pl/search?q=site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fchaudesonline.com%2F&amp;amp;ie=utf-8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;aq=t&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla:pl:official&amp;amp;client=firefox-a#q=site:http://chaudesonline.com/&amp;amp;hl=pl&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;hs=buO&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla:pl:official&amp;amp;prmd=imvns&amp;amp;ei=lqpLT6bHDISZOrytyOMF&amp;amp;start=80&amp;amp;sa=N&amp;amp;fp=1&amp;amp;biw=1280&amp;amp;bih=888&amp;amp;cad=b&amp;amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.,cf.osb&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yes, adding 301 redirect to Home Page in files 404.php, archive.php, index.php helps a bit, but it is not a proper fix.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Any ideas what is going on?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don't know what is generating these urls! Try adding these to your blogs!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
blog.wordpress.org have the same problem!
&lt;/p&gt;

+1 to integrating the WordPress Filesystem API into the library.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So you don't think it would be a problem to refactor that library / ie: alter the source code? (it could use some rehabilitation IMHO)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A problem in what sense: license, or implementation? If it's GPLv2, then license isn't an issue; we can modify it however we want. If it's ease of implementation, I don't know. Probably not something I have the chops for. Groking the Filesystem API is on my list of things to do, but it probably won't happen in time for the 3.4 release.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I just think that, 1) as a matter of principle of using core APIs were possible, and 2) as a matter of not introducing server configuration issues for end users, using the Filesystem API is the right approach.
&lt;/p&gt;

ImageICO library works great as advertised. Only concern is that it uses fopen() and fwrite() to create the local file, and I wonder whether this could be a problem.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If this &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a concern, then there are two strategies:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;edit/change the library to use more WP core methods
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;capture the ICO on stdout and save it that way.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Any thoughts? I could use some guidance on the best practice here.

First of all, the action should be called 'wp_mail_failed', to be consistent with 'wp_loaded' and others.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I second this, good thinking.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Most emails are sent during a POST action, which is usually followed by a redirect, so I don't see the point in calling trigger_error().
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Even if we were to call trigger_error(), it should be through a callback hooked into 'wp_mail_failed', so that it's easy for plugins to disable.
&lt;/p&gt;

error_log() is probably plugin territory, but trigger_error() for E_WARNING might not be.

I think we should always log mail errors under &lt;code&gt;WP_DEBUG&lt;/code&gt;, too.
&lt;/p&gt;

How about putting in all the original &lt;code&gt; $to, $subject, $message, $headers = '', $attachments = array() &lt;/code&gt; set of data, that is implementation independent, isn't it? Any disadvantages?
&lt;/p&gt;

Looks pretty good to me, best implementation with all relevant data.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Might be useful, although WordPress doesn't seem to log errors too much, only a couple of "third-party" classes (wpdb, simplePIE, POP3, etc.) contain error log writes; can't see much logging going on in the core itself, except deprecated functions firing errors off.
&lt;/p&gt;

Good concern and good answer. However, passing the phpMailer object allows to give more context and retrieve its attributes (from, to, subject, message, etc.) Could passing a less typed set of these attributes (associative array?) in addition be the best compromise?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The inner implementation may change in the future, PHPMailer could be switched for something completely different. But we could use the third optional &lt;code&gt; $data &lt;/code&gt; parameter of the &lt;code&gt; WP_Error &lt;/code&gt; to pass along the relevant data, might be useful indeed.
&lt;/p&gt;

Just uploaded version 2.3 of the ImageICO php library that has been re-released under the GPLv2 license. As always, you can check the details at jpexs website: &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://www.jpexs.com/php.html"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://www.jpexs.com/php.html&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is great. Thanks for championing this. We need to make sure that if we do end up using this library, it's acknowledged in the credits along with the other libs that are used. Might be nice to do a blog post about the new favicon feature and credit the library author.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Before we go too far, I'll try rolling it in to the next patch and let's see if it does what we need it to do.
&lt;/p&gt;

Nitpick: Why is that function called get_favicon_thumbnail_img()? Shouldn't it be just get_favicon_img()?

Yep. Will do.

Hey @azaozz could you take a look at line 144 in &lt;code&gt;wpeditimage/editor_plugin_src.js' in the context of &lt;/code&gt;From URL` tab (I'm asking because you already did some changes there).
Thanks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Regarding &lt;code&gt;ob_start()&lt;/code&gt;, I would leave it for later. To be honest, I don't see any reason why buffers should be avoided...

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Remember that links to private content that a visitor has no access to will result in a 404. &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Content_Visibility#Private_Content"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://codex.wordpress.org/Content_Visibility#Private_Content&lt;/a&gt;
This is especially true for crawlers, you will get 404 even though your content exists for you.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For possible non-core-based solutions to this refer to:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/11427/how-to-301-private-posts-rather-than-404"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/11427/how-to-301-private-posts-rather-than-404&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/9017/how-do-i-display-content-to-users-who-are-not-logged-in-instead-of-404-on-privat"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/9017/how-do-i-display-content-to-users-who-are-not-logged-in-instead-of-404-on-privat&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The attached diff shows private posts in the lists. Patch will not work on 3.3.1, since many things have been moved around in that area.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
JS would require proper localization for the word "Private" if this enhancement/defect is considered. If not, use &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;HTML links&lt;/a&gt;.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I have been thinking a lot about the issue of getting error messages from &lt;code&gt; wp_mail &lt;/code&gt; lately and stumbled upon this ticket today, decided to explore the problem-solution space a bit with a small and mostly obvious article.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://codeseekah.com/2012/02/27/getting-error-feedback-from-wp_mail/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://codeseekah.com/2012/02/27/getting-error-feedback-from-wp_mail/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'm attaching two diffs that that pass a WP_Error object, instead of the exception as the internal implementation may change in the future. One using a filter, another using an action. Both are not too comfortable to use, but we can probably work something out from there + decide on a better hook name, probably specific to &lt;code&gt; wp_mail &lt;/code&gt;, again, in case internal implementation changes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Probably missing something, ready to discuss further.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #19528 (HTML editor link quicktag not working in IE9) updated</title>
      
        <dc:creator>solarissmoke</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Feb 2012 08:23:32 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/19528#comment:2</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/19528#comment:2/1330331012148446</guid>
      <description>&lt;i&gt;Keywords&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Tracked this down to the following code in &lt;code&gt;wplink.dev.js&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;if ( typeof textarea.selectionStart !== 'undefined' ) {
	start       = textarea.selectionStart;
	end         = textarea.selectionEnd;
	selection   = textarea.value.substring( start, end );
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This was originally designed to bypass IE which didn't support &lt;code&gt;selectionStart&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;selectionEnd&lt;/code&gt;. However IE9 does. Problem is it sets both attributes to 0 when the textarea loses focus, which is what causes the behaviour described above.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Attached a patch that fixes this by storing the selection information &lt;strong&gt;before&lt;/strong&gt; the textarea loses focus. This seems to me a better approach generally, as from what I can see the HTML5 spec doesn't explicitly say what should happen to selection data when focus is lost, so IE9 is not necessarily wrong in how it handles it.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
The bug appears when you insert an image and add an external link.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The link is 'saved' to the editor, but then reverts when 'Update' is clicked.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The workaround is to remove: rel="attachment wp-att-999" from the &amp;lt;a href ="link to external" rel="attachment wp-att-999"&amp;gt;.
Hence, the bug is probably being caused by rel="attachment wp-att-999 being improperly inserted in the &amp;lt;a href&amp;gt; tag when trying to link to an externalI (non-image attachment) URL.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My patch tries to allow common, reasonable tags to be output. I use "wp_kses_data", which will only allow tags defined in the $allowedtags variable.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Generally WordPress does not restrict plugins in this manner - IMO that's what makes the plugin API so powerful. I think it's the responsibility of plugin authors to make sure their code doesn't break things.
&lt;/p&gt;

Here's the way I'm reading this code / documentation:  &lt;code&gt;add_settings_error&lt;/code&gt; is expecting &lt;code&gt;$message&lt;/code&gt; to contain pre-sanitized data and to be formatted exactly as the theme developer intends.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The docs say this:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt; * @param string $message The formatted message text to display to the user (will be shown inside styled &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I would argue that any user data being passed through this function should already be sanitized.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;add_settings_error( 'zdt-setting', '1023', 'The value: ' . wp_kses_data( $val ) . ' is not allowed' );
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Otherwise WordPress should dump this data out directly.
&lt;/p&gt;

+1 to this. It would allow plugins to make Welcome/Credits pages similar to WordPress core, without needing to pollute the admin menu.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Having some issues with &lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/16458/16458.diff" title="Attachment '16458.diff' in Ticket #16458"&gt;16458.diff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/16458/16458.diff" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt; on 3.4-alpha-19998, Twenty Eleven, default media settings.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Uploading &lt;code&gt;Untitled.jpg&lt;/code&gt; (1000x1000) results in 6 files:
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;Untitled.jpg
Untitled-1000x288.jpg
Untitled-150x150.jpg
Untitled-300x300.jpg
Untitled1-1000x288.jpg
Untitled1-300x300.jpg
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Two of them are the same, so there should be only four. Apparently &lt;code&gt;image_resize()&lt;/code&gt; can be called multiple times with the same parameters.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start="2"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Uploading &lt;code&gt;Untitled.jpeg&lt;/code&gt; then results in 4 files:
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;Untitled.jpeg
Untitled-1000x288.jpg
Untitled-150x150.jpg
Untitled-300x300.jpg
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Three of them overwrite the intermediate sizes of the previous image. This creates orphaned DB records when either image is deleted.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Without the patch, issue 2 still happens, but issue 1 doesn't.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We can probably just preserve &lt;code&gt;.jpeg&lt;/code&gt; extension (&lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/16458/16458.2.diff" title="Attachment '16458.2.diff' in Ticket #16458"&gt;16458.2.diff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/16458/16458.2.diff" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt;).

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
The shortcodes work similarly to HTML with &lt;code&gt;[&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;]&lt;/code&gt; being the equivalent of &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. In that terms shortcodes cannot contain square brackets the same way HTML tags cannot contain "less than" and "greater than" chars. If they must be used, they need to be encoded/replaced with entities.
&lt;/p&gt;

Replying to &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/19910#comment:11" title="Comment 11"&gt;nacin&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yes it can. And in fact, it does, due to how the preview iframe works. There is no actual harm to placing JS in wp-includes over wp-admin. The rule of thumb I have used is that if it is a library of sorts, or decoupled nicely from the admin, or something that could be employed on the frontend (like pointers), it should go into wp-includes. The only things that should go into wp-admin is code intrinsically tied to the admin interface.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yes, in general there's no harm. I was talking about the php and css code too, not only the JS. Imho it doesn't make sense all these files to be in wp-includes as they all are only used when the user is in the admin and are useless on the front-end.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There is not another framework here, nor is there a whole lot of complexity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Not exactly. The JS is build as a framework on top of jQuery with the actual functions that "do the work" being several levels "deep". Don't see a point in having JS classes for a few jQuery based single-use lines of JS.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For the JS files, no. They are loaded in different places. customize-loader.js handles the ability to load the customizer. customize-controls gets loaded in the frame that handles the controls. customize-preview gets loaded in the preview iframe. customize-base is a shared base class of both customize-preview and customize-controls. As they are nicely decoupled, they should remain separate.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Agreed. Generally loading one larger JS file is better than segmenting it into several small files as after the first load the browsers keep all of it in memory cache. The same is true for the css. However when using JS concatenation the file that is loaded would probably be already different so the browsers would have to load it again.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For the PHP files, no. Individual classes belong in separate files. The fourth file, customize-controls.php, is a special file that is included to handle the controls after WP is hijacked.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'm not sure it's a good idea to use OOP structures to output HTML in a non-OOP app. There is only one screen so there is only one "instance" of the HTML. What's the point of building specific OOP structure for only this part of the code that is used only once? But that discussion is not for here.
&lt;/p&gt;

Use case: changing sidebars depending on the page/post/etc loaded through a plugin. Nothing too complex, just no way to do it. There is a filter dynamic_sidebar_params but that isn't called until later on in the function after the widgets have been collected for that sidebar.
&lt;/p&gt;
