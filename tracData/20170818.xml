      <description>&lt;i&gt;Keywords&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Replying to &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40199#comment:9" title="Comment 9"&gt;westonruter&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
@melchoyce I'm unclear of where else in the Customizer this would be applied.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For WP_Customize_Media_Control and all children, with an instance parameter (my thought was to call it &lt;code&gt;library&lt;/code&gt;) for controls that want to opt-in to facilitating switching between various previously-used settings for a control. Site icon (&lt;a class="reopened ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32861" title="#32861: enhancement: Site Icon: Provide display for all existing site-icon cropped images (reopened)"&gt;#32861&lt;/a&gt;, where a tab in the media modal or a slide-out panel are the most recent suggestions) and background image are probably the only other core controls that should opt-in.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I would encourage an exploration into other UI options such as the add-widgets fly-out panel, which may be more appropriate in terms of API convention. Regardless, the implementation of the current approach should be done as new functionality that happens within a control object as opposed to using a &lt;code&gt;section&lt;/code&gt;. Single-&lt;code&gt;control&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;section&lt;/code&gt;s are discouraged, as the purpose of a section is to group multiple controls together. Rather, this should be implemented as a more complex &lt;code&gt;control&lt;/code&gt; and can provide the illusion of sliding into another visual "panel" (like the add-menu-item control, particularly on mobile), use a modal, or potentially take a more inline approach to expanding to show additional items.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All of this should probably be happening in &lt;a class="new ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/36581" title="#36581: enhancement: Customizer Header Image Control should extend the cropped image control (new)"&gt;#36581&lt;/a&gt; if we want to actually fix it. &lt;a class="new ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/36581" title="#36581: enhancement: Customizer Header Image Control should extend the cropped image control (new)"&gt;#36581&lt;/a&gt; is an absolute prerequisite to doing this, at a minimum. I thought there was an additional distinct ticket to extract the library functionality back to the base controls, but that seems to be &lt;a class="new ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/36581" title="#36581: enhancement: Customizer Header Image Control should extend the cropped image control (new)"&gt;#36581&lt;/a&gt; as well. Previously: &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/29211" title="#29211: task (blessed): Customizer: extract a cropped-image control from header images (closed: fixed)"&gt;#29211&lt;/a&gt;. This ticket was for an interim solution and can be closed (or the summary and description rewritten) if we go with the full fix, which it sounds like there's interest in doing. The quick fix being to hide the images as a space-saving measure, rather than improving the functionality more broadly. Any improvements to header images need to coincide with allowing those improvements to apply to all media controls, which will be straightforward once &lt;a class="new ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/36581" title="#36581: enhancement: Customizer Header Image Control should extend the cropped image control (new)"&gt;#36581&lt;/a&gt; is complete.

      <description>maybelater: &lt;p&gt;
Similar to with logos in &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38329" title="#38329: enhancement: Create positioning control for Custom Logos (closed: maybelater)"&gt;#38329&lt;/a&gt;, the first step would be themes implementing this functionality by reusing the core controls available for background images (which should not be difficult to do). Once there's more of a demonstrated desire for it, it could potentially become part of the core add-theme-support for headers similar to backgrounds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
MY sense is that there are too many options in both the header and background image theme-supports currently, and that most are only still there because of backwards compatibility. The core functionality is already moving away from headers implemented with &lt;code&gt;background-image&lt;/code&gt; since that doesn't work for video headers. It's not likely that we'd add more options for these theme-supports unless enough themes implement their own versions of this that it makes sense for core to provide a standardized implementation. If that happens in the future, we can revisit this then.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Also, +1 to including the dropdown-pages control and making use of the Rest API there, although perhaps the options should be included with the control params?

Replying to &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31779#comment:46" title="Comment 46"&gt;cliffseal&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If it's not an option to remove or disable-by-default this editor, I think a combination of other simultaneous changes could support this effort:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Move the Editor into the Tools menu, or into Tools &amp;gt; Available Tools. It fits better there anyway: it's not a visual editor for the &lt;em&gt;Appearance&lt;/em&gt;, as other things are in the Appearance menu), but the other problem with Plugins &amp;gt; Editor is it's right beside one of the most clicked buttons in the UI (Add New). It's too easy to discover. You could also move the warning messages suggested above into a box on Available Tools. Instead of a warning, it becomes the context for launching the Editor. Plus, what else is going on in that page anyway. :)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
+1
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;ol start="2"&gt;&lt;li&gt;To do the above, combine the Theme and Plugin editors into one. Separate the edit dropdown with headings for Theme and Plugins.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This makes a lot of sense. There are functionally few cases where the distinction between them needs to manifest in entirely separate editors. Much of the text, functionality, and warnings about changes being overwritten by updates apply to both plugins and themes. It also further promotes the use of additional CSS for visual adjustments, with the editor(s) being a place for more involved changes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;ol start="3"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make Editor access a setting in Settings &amp;gt; General. I saw the argument that having to set the constant doesn't make sense for the people using the Editor—this is a solution that still hides the danger by default but has a low barrier to enablement.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In terms of discoverability for the people that benefit most from this functionality, it's probably better not to introduce a user-facing option for this.
&lt;/p&gt;

Perhaps we could get an update as to what is still needed to get this in place?
How can we get there?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If @helen is okay with exploring an initial core implementation that does not rewrite the admin &lt;em&gt;menu&lt;/em&gt; API, then then next step would be for someone to clean up the CSS in the plugin and start encouraging testing and user testing for feedback. It could likely use additional work to ensure that the multisite experience is improved.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/helen/wp-toolbar-experiments"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://github.com/helen/wp-toolbar-experiments&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/32678/32678.5.diff" title="Attachment '32678.5.diff' in Ticket #32678"&gt;32678.5.diff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/32678/32678.5.diff" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt; are starting points.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Key question: are we okay with iterative improvements to work toward an idealized eventual solution, or do we want to tackle everything (content, appearance, interaction, multisite, API, etc.) at once? My preference is to focus on the &lt;em&gt;content&lt;/em&gt; as outlined in &lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/32678/wpadmin-bar-concept-i10.png" title="Attachment 'wpadmin-bar-concept-i10.png' in Ticket #32678"&gt;wpadmin-bar-concept-i10.png&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/32678/wpadmin-bar-concept-i10.png" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt; first and then continue making iterative improvements to other aspects.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #30277 (Split up Customizer JS into separate files and remove self-booting ...) updated</title>

Replying to &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30277#comment:19" title="Comment 19"&gt;westonruter&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think this makes the most sense to be done as part of a Customizer rewrite, perhaps in a feature plugin powered by the new  &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/WP-API/wp-api-customize-endpoints"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;endpoints&lt;/a&gt; and making use of React or Vue to power the UI, while naturally maintaining the same Customize JS API.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As long as this is entirely an "internal" rewrite and the JS API remains fully backwards-compatible, I can get behind this idea. That would definitely be the best time to restructure files. I am somewhat skeptical of full backwards compatibility being achievable with such a rewrite, but that's the primary requirement that we would need to consider in such a project.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #40451 (Customizer: Introduce plugin management) updated</title>
      
        <dc:creator>celloexpressions</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Fri, 18 Aug 2017 22:03:37 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40451#comment:6</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40451#comment:6/1503093817195965</guid>
      <description>&lt;i&gt;Priority&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I was also initially uncertain about the usefulness of this. However, there are many good plugins that do one thing and do not require configuration beyond being activated - those plugins benefit significantly from live preview. And really, it should be a goal long-term to allow plugins to be fully live-previewed along with any other aspect of managing a site.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Each time that a plugin activation is toggled on, it would need to refresh the entire customizer (as is done for themes) so that any customizations can be done, as a plugin could be doing a lot of script enqueues and style enqueues as well as any other number of arbitrary templates getting printed to the page, and so on. It would not be reliable to just try to look at differences to which panels/sections/controls/settings are registered.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For both plugins and themes, the long-term idea is that rather than reloading the customizer entirely, the customize controls pane can be selectively updated via an ajax call that essentially provides a diff between customize objects (and enqueued scripts/styles, by running the customize-specific hooks) that were available before and after the theme switch/plugin activation. Any added objects could be added and any removed ones removed via the JS API, and JS-templated controls particularly lend themselves to this approach (this is also the sort of behavior that &lt;a class="new ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30741" title="#30741: enhancement: Build-out API for adding Customizer Panels, Sections, and Controls ... (new)"&gt;#30741&lt;/a&gt; aims to eventually enable). Additional scripts and styles could also be loaded. The preview would be the only thing requiring a refresh. Plugins could potentially also opt-in to additional hooks to facilitate this behavior or prompt the user to do a full reload if absolutely necessary (this would likely be limited to plugins modifying the customizer itself).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The 4.1-era thought was that this functionality was a prerequisite to customize-based theme switching; in 4.2 we implemented an intermediate approach that matinains the full page load for now. Eventually, that should be implemented for both themes and plugins, allowing full live previews without page loads.
&lt;/p&gt;

Using the category widget with the display as dropdown mode (which is completely keyboard-inaccessible, although I couldn't find a ticket for that either), changing the cateogry navigates the preview out of the preview, leading to easily nesting customizer iframes via the toolbar navigation that shows up.

I'm happy to put together another patch moving those spaces out of the strings, but I'll hold off to see if any other changes are needed as well :)

Using the transparency pattern is a good idea, but I think in practice it might be a little too distracting. &lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/41630/41630.2.diff" title="Attachment '41630.2.diff' in Ticket #41630"&gt;41630.2.diff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/41630/41630.2.diff" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt; looks good to commit to me 👍 Thanks for working on this, @mrasharirfan :)

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Thanks @mrahmadawais :)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I noticed that there's still some spacing issues in in-between points, like in &lt;a class="missing attachment"&gt;Shot 2017-08-18 at 1.31.36 PM.png&lt;/a&gt;, which is between ~664–774px.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I also noticed that once it hits 774px and lower in Chrome on OSX, the spacing between the buttons disappears.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
FIX: Button Spacing for Image Media Widget &amp;amp; Widget List Margin on Small Screens
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This looks good 👍 Happy for that to go in as-is, though it might also be nice to try decreasing the vertical padding overall to something like &lt;code&gt;15px 15px 15px 60px&lt;/code&gt; to save space. The touch-target would still be about 66px, which is above the recommended minimum size on iOS (44px).
&lt;/p&gt;

Hi @megabytesupport,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thanks for opening your first WordPress core ticket. The issue you're reporting seems specific to WooCommerce, not WordPress core itself. The more appropriate place to report the issue is on WooCommerce's GitHub repo: &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/issues"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/issues&lt;/a&gt;

I'm new to the core contribution section, but this seems to be a bug with the WooCommerce Plugin, not the WordPress Core.

&lt;p&gt;
and maybe move the alt text up, since it's even more important than "Title"
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Could also be a good to tell people in a sentence why they should add alt text. Maybe even quickly describe all of the fields and what they do... I'll think about this and try sketching some ideas :)

      <title>Ticket #27110 (Allow filtering the plugin list in the admin) updated</title>
      
        <dc:creator>ideag</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Fri, 18 Aug 2017 15:44:23 GMT</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Could we please revisit this? It seems very weird that we have a hook to add additional links to the &lt;code&gt;views&lt;/code&gt; line above plugin list, but that there is no clean way to make the list table to display anything but he default plugin list once you click that link.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If that was a conscious decision, to not allow plugin developers to mess with that screen, I can understand that, though it is a bit futile, as there are ways to get around that (not nice ways, but ways nonetheless). You can hook into a different hook and modify &lt;code&gt;$plugins&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;$totals&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;$status&lt;/code&gt; WP globals to achieve that, as demonstrated here: &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/ideag/TinyLibraries/blob/master/tinylibraries.php#L104-L121"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://github.com/ideag/TinyLibraries/blob/master/tinylibraries.php#L104-L121&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If this was just overlooked, I'd be happy to provide a patch for this.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I favor the second option, since it avoids looking into the subdirectories unnecessarily. (The third option would do that as well, however, it would require duplicate logic.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I also think the second option would be the best way to go and has the least chance of having unintended side-effects. I'll try to put together a patch and some unit tests over the weekend.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;remove some trailing commas to make jshint happy

Question: do we still need these tests if we no longer support older versions of IE?

@rcutmore - nice work here!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In &lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/41111/41111.2.diff" title="Attachment '41111.2.diff' in Ticket #41111"&gt;41111.2.diff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/41111/41111.2.diff" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt; I moved the code up a bit into the utility section, ultimately we will probably split this file back up so wanted to group the functions with the other helpers. Also, I clarified the return value would be undefined if not matching item is found and I switched out &lt;code&gt;_.first( _.filter(...&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;_.find(...&lt;/code&gt; which should also return the first item matching the predicate. This makes the code a little more legible and all the unit tests continued to pass.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
There is still a possibility for widgets to end up there if we can't match one sidebar up to another, it's just less likely. Also users might decide to "park" a widget there, regardless of a theme switch.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I tried a total purge of caches already with the same result. I tried adding another product with the same price and receive the same result. The price should not be 20.55 but 21.99 as reflected on the product details.
&lt;/p&gt;

Does it mean we can get rid out of it?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don't think so. I feel like there should be a place for widgets that have active settings but are currently not shown.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yeah! but how will these widgets show in the Inactive Widgets sidebar now with this new patch?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Or you mean the widgets that are currently in the Inactive Widgets widget area so after WordPress update they will show there..., but after a theme switch they will not be there anymore, right?
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;i&gt;Keywords&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
@ideag Yeah, it seems that there are really three solutions:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sort the results from &lt;code&gt;get_plugins()&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add a parameter to &lt;code&gt;get_plugins()&lt;/code&gt; to skip checking in subdirectories.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don't use &lt;code&gt;get_plugins()&lt;/code&gt; at all, as in &lt;code&gt;Plugin_Upgrader::check_package()&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I favor the second option, since it avoids looking into the subdirectories unnecessarily. (The third option would do that as well, however, it would require duplicate logic.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But maybe @dd32 and @SergeyBiryukov would like to give their opinion.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Thanks for update.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I tested and what I can say it works better than it was before when after a theme switch all widgets move to Inactive Widgets sidebar.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Does it mean we can get rid out of it? I have a ticket for this too and it was closed again by &lt;strong&gt;westonruter&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40219" title="#40219: enhancement: Remove Inactive Widgets widget area from widgets.php page (closed: wontfix)"&gt;#40219&lt;/a&gt; .

Side note: I could've done it manually, but writing a command to do it for me was much more interesting, even if it took twice as long.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;for i in `find . -name *_*`; do svn mv $i `echo $i | sed -e 's/_\([a-z]\)/\U\1/g'`; done

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Hi! I just ran into this issue and I'd like to help closing it, but I am wondering what would be the preferred solution for it. I would probably prefer modifying get_plugins to optionally ignore sub-directories, but I've also seen suggestions to modify the order of output to make sure files  directly in plugin directory are at the top of the list.
&lt;/p&gt;

Any objections to making this a &lt;code&gt;good-first-bug&lt;/code&gt;?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
SVN doesn't properly reflect file copying/renaming in patches, so this can only be done on commit.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Indeed. That's why I couldn't provide one when I opened the ticket.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
When taxonomies use numbers in their title, and the list is ordered alphabetically, they come out in the following order:
1
10
11
2
20
21
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Resolution should lead to proper sorting of numbered tags.
&lt;/p&gt;

There doesn't appear to be any particular standard for naming test files, but it looks like camelCase is the most common, so I'm cool with using that.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There is now: &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/automated-testing/phpunit/#naming"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/automated-testing/phpunit/#naming&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
These new docs changes are based on "PHP Unit testing" #coe chats from ~18 months ago
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/02/12/php-unit-test-discussion-feb-12-recap/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/02/12/php-unit-test-discussion-feb-12-recap/&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Writing Tests - Naming
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tests should be organized in such a way that they’re easy to find and easy to run in isolation.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Generally the test file path has taken the form &lt;code&gt;/tests/phpunit/tests/{component}/{functionInCamelCase}.php&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Generally a file’s test class has taken the form &lt;code&gt;Tests_{Component}_{FunctionInCamelCase}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Test method names should take the format &lt;code&gt;test_{{description_of_what_is_expected}}&lt;/code&gt;. For example, &lt;code&gt;test_termmeta_cache_should_be_primed_by_default&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sometimes it’s handy to have things like &lt;code&gt;/tests/phpunit/tests/query/orderby.php&lt;/code&gt;, which is not about a function name but instead about a part of the query infrastructure
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hello Sergey,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'm not sure because my gravity form is not yet update.
I think it's on the JQuery part?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thanks

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
This patch replaces the path, the functions and the actions with &lt;code&gt;%s&lt;/code&gt; placeholder. This way translators can't mistakenly changes to wrong function names.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Old translation string:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Likely direct inclusion of wp-admin/includes/template.php in order to use add_meta_box(). This is very wrong. Hook the add_meta_box() call into the add_meta_boxes action instead.&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
New translation string:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Likely direct inclusion of %1$s in order to use %2$s. This is very wrong. Hook the %2$s call into the %3$s action instead.&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The patch also adds translators comments and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags around the function/action names.
&lt;/p&gt;

The patch also adds a period at the end of the sentence and it has a small text change to match the other string.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Old translation strings:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;The register_routes() method must be overridden&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Method '%s' not implemented. Must be overridden in subclass.&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
New translation strings:

This patch has several changes:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It replaces the &lt;code&gt;register_routes()&lt;/code&gt; method with a &lt;code&gt;%s&lt;/code&gt; placeholder.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It replaces the apostrophe around the &lt;code&gt;%s&lt;/code&gt; placeholders with &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It adds translators comments to all the translation strings.

I tried to replicate the issue but I can't. I used Twenty Seventeen with an active child theme. The child theme was just a CSS file. The only active plugins were Query Monitor and BuddyPress.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Are there any active plugins?
&lt;/p&gt;

@torndownunits did the temp fix work for WC ? it's not working for me.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yes, I used the plugin from post &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25" title="#25: defect (bug): Missing http:// with website for user profile (closed: fixed)"&gt;#25&lt;/a&gt;.   It's not ideal but it makes the Product Categories hierarchy at least display correctly in Appearance--&amp;gt; Menus (using View All) which is what I needed.  It was a mess before, and now the hierarchy of everything is at least correct.  Using the editor with dozens (never mind hundreds) of items is a pain still, but I can use it.    Also, I ended up here from your posts at Woo.   But isn't this a problem with all items in the Menu editor, not just Woo items?  The editor basically is just horrible when dealing with dozens (never mind hundreds) of options in general.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
woocommerce (mikejolley) said they could fix it but i was the only one complaining about it. they need more ppl reporting it so they take the time to fix it. plz, ask them to fix this bug or it never going to be fixed :(.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I didn't see them say they'd fix anything?  They said it's a problem with Wordpress, which it is.  It's not specifically a problem with Woo taxonomies, it's a problem with all taxonomies. It's not really their problem to fix.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I tried the patch to no avail:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That patch is for pages (and other hierarchial post types), not for taxonomies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I've created a workaround plugin to preserve hierarchy for both post types and taxonomies:
&lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/18282/preserve-page-and-taxonomy-hierarchy.php" title="Attachment 'preserve-page-and-taxonomy-hierarchy.php' in Ticket #18282"&gt;preserve-page-and-taxonomy-hierarchy.php&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/18282/preserve-page-and-taxonomy-hierarchy.php" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Note that it only affects "View All" tab, not "Most Recent" or "Most Used".
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So where do we add this file to?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Make a folder inside your plugins folder.  Put the file in it.  Go into your dashboard, go to plugins, activate it.  You will see it listed in your plugins.
&lt;/p&gt;

Old translation string:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Could not open handle for fopen() to %s&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
New translation string:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Could not open handle for %1$s to %2$s.&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The function can be mistakenly changes by the translator. The best practice is to replace the &lt;code&gt;fopen()&lt;/code&gt; function with a &lt;code&gt;%s&lt;/code&gt; placeholder.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The patch also adds a period at the end of the sentence and adds translators comments.

Hi @emantoyaks, welcome to WordPress Trac! Thanks for the report.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Have you reported this to Gravity Forms support? The code sample you've provided is just basic jQuery code, I don't see why a WordPress update would break it.
&lt;/p&gt;

Hi @ovidiuav, welcome to WordPress Trac! Thanks for the report.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Replying to &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/41664" title="#41664: defect (bug): Romanian diacritics are wrong (closed: worksforme)"&gt;ovidiuav&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I recently wanted to set my blog's language to Romanian and I noticed that WordPress doesn't use the correct diacritical marks for Romanian. WP uses cedillas instead of commas ('ș' &amp;amp; 'ț' are correct, 'ş' &amp;amp; 'ţ' are not).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Where exactly do you see incorrect diacritical marks? Does the issue happen on the front end or in WP admin?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Does it still happen with all plugins disabled and a default theme (Twenty Seventeen) activated?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;
WordPress should not perform any character conversion like that by itself, this sounds like an issue with a particular font used in your theme.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
you know what, you're right, it's because of the font. also checked the Dashboard btw and WP is actually using the correct marks, so there's no WP issue after all.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
however, the font supports both types of marks, it has no trouble displaying both of them when the blog is set to English. when i switch to Romanian, though, for some reason commas are displayed as cedillas (front end). any idea why that is?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
thank you!
&lt;/p&gt;

Replying to &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39896#comment:23" title="Comment 23"&gt;JoshuaWold&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;@westonruter if we go the non-linear route, what do you think about having the other changesets at the bottom of this panel? As shown in the attachment above.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yes, having a list of the other changesets here I think makes sense. Note that this list would naturally tie in naturally with adding changeset revisions to the Customizer, as a draft/scheduled post are essentially revisions that have not yet been published/committed yet. See &lt;a class="assigned ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21666" title="#21666: feature request: Customizer reset/undo/revert (assigned)"&gt;#21666&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="new ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31089" title="#31089: enhancement: Customize: Add revisions for changesets (new)"&gt;#31089&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;ol start="2"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Would we want to give the ability to edit/delete settings?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yes, in that it would allow a user to switch to that changeset to make additional changes. In other words, it would be like in the Customize Snapshots plugin how you can navigate to the list of changesets in the WP Admin and click “Customize” to open it in the Customizer to make additional changes. The UI for reverting a change from a changeset I think would be integrated somewhere else, like within each control for which there is a changed/dirty setting there could be a revert button, but that can come in a future release. (This capability exists in Customize Snapshots today by “inspecting” a changeset in the WP Admin edit post screen and clicking the “Remove setting” links.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;ol start="3"&gt;&lt;li&gt;If I change the changeset to "save draft", what do you think about having the option to set the title show?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
See also &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/152"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;this issue&lt;/a&gt; in Customize Snapshots where the title could potentially default to a list of the controls that the user interacted with.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Being able to specify the title for the changeset would be I think important if we go with implementing branching/non-linear changesets. But then again, if we do implement branching changesets then what we're going to inevitably come up against is conflicts between two separate changesets. So part of me thinks that we should go with the linear option for 4.9.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But with the linear option, if there can only ever be one non-published changeset at once, would this be inherently problematic for drafted and scheduled changesets? If I schedule some changes to go live on Saturday night, and today is Thursday, then this would basically block the Customizer from being used to make changes until that changeset is published since you'd open the Customizer with the scheduled changeset loaded in. This wouldn't be a problem for branching changesets, but then there would be the issue of how to handle (or not handle) conflicts between two unpublished changesets. Some options for conflict resolution have been explored/discussed in Customize Snapshots, including adding indicators on controls for which there are other changesets which have pending changes. Potentially such controls could be “locked” from being edited, like post locking, if there is another changeset already has its setting as being modified. Anyway, there would be some interesting challenges to solve here.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;i&gt;Keywords&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Hi @ovidiuav, welcome to WordPress Trac! Thanks for the report.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Replying to &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/41664" title="#41664: defect (bug): Romanian diacritics are wrong (closed: worksforme)"&gt;ovidiuav&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I recently wanted to set my blog's language to Romanian and I noticed that WordPress doesn't use the correct diacritical marks for Romanian. WP uses cedillas instead of commas ('ș' &amp;amp; 'ț' are correct, 'ş' &amp;amp; 'ţ' are not).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Where exactly do you see incorrect diacritical marks? Does the issue happen on the front end or in WP admin?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Does it still happen with all plugins disabled and a default theme (Twenty Seventeen) activated?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;
WordPress should not perform any character conversion like that by itself, this sounds like an issue with a particular font used in your theme.
&lt;/p&gt;

This patch remove the empty units for 4 tests :-)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Are missing:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;There were 4 risky tests:
1) WP_Test_REST_Pages_Controller::test_prepare_item
This test did not perform any assertions
2) WP_Test_REST_Settings_Controller::test_context_param
This test did not perform any assertions
3) WP_Test_REST_Settings_Controller::test_prepare_item
This test did not perform any assertions
4) WP_Test_REST_Settings_Controller::test_get_item_schema
This test did not perform any assertions
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I am not sure about &lt;code&gt;prepare&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;context&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;get_item_schema&lt;/code&gt; tests about what they have to do.

I get some warnings after theme install:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hm, I hoped I had those fixed. You said you can't reproduce them anymore?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I can! It seems when there a not widgets in any sidebars - warnings occur.
How to replicate:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Remove all widgets in every theme.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Activate another theme.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</description>

I tested this in my local environment but could not re-create the issue. I'm pretty sure there is some small theme specific issue or plugin conflict.

      <pubDate>Thu, 17 Aug 2017 20:09:07 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/41665</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/41665/1503000547667679</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I have two themes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Parent Theme and Child Theme.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Child Theme is the active theme.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As per the Theme Developer Handbook, &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/template-files-section/page-template-files/#creating-custom-page-templates-for-global-use"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;Creating Custom Page Templates for Global Use&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I've defined a simple page template to be used globally like so:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;/**
 * Template Name: One Column
 */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ....
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;?&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The above code is placed into a file called &lt;code&gt;one-column.php&lt;/code&gt; and for simplicity, placed into the theme root directory of the parent theme.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When I edit a page in the backend, the &lt;code&gt;page-attributes&lt;/code&gt; metabox has no option for a drop down menu at all. Yet, clearly I have a page template defined in the parent theme. It should be showing up, shouldn't it?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now... If I take the same exact page template file and move it into the root directory of the active child theme, and edit a page in the backend, the &lt;code&gt;page-attributes&lt;/code&gt; metabox suddenly has a dropdown menu containing my page template (as expected).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My question is, why are page templates defined in the parent theme of the active child theme completely ignored?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now to further test my point even more. Leave the &lt;code&gt;one-column.php&lt;/code&gt; file in the root directory of the active child theme and add another page template file called &lt;code&gt;two-columns.php&lt;/code&gt; and place this file into the root directory of the parent theme.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Contents of &lt;code&gt;two-columns.php&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;/**
 * Template Name: Two Columns
 */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ....
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;?&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Edit a page, and take a gander at the dropdown menu in the &lt;code&gt;page-attributes&lt;/code&gt; metabox. You will only see the page template of "One Column" as defined by &lt;code&gt;one-column.php&lt;/code&gt; in the root directory of the active child theme. You will not see "Two Columns" as defined by &lt;code&gt;two-columns.php&lt;/code&gt; defined in the root directory of the parent theme.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Potential Start on Tracing/Debugging:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

I get some warnings after theme install:

Hm, I hoped I had those fixed. You said you can't reproduce them anymore?

Strange the warning come from nowhere...
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Maybe I patched twice...
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Can't replicate the warnings, today first time patched a file, for WordPress.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I tested twice and it seems to work nice for me. So after making all steps in the &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40177" title="#40177: defect (bug): sidebars_widgets option is not updated after activating a theme on ... (closed: duplicate)"&gt;#40177&lt;/a&gt; ticked all file changes seems to work and I get the right widget in the sidebar I was looking for.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #41664 (Romanian diacritics are wrong) created</title>
      
        <dc:creator>ovidiuav</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Thu, 17 Aug 2017 19:16:00 GMT</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Hi guys,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I recently wanted to set my blog's language to Romanian and I noticed that WordPress doesn't use the correct diacritical marks for Romanian. WP uses cedillas instead of commas ('ș' &amp;amp; 'ț' are correct, 'ş' &amp;amp; 'ţ' are not).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I guess it wouldn't be a big deal if WP didn't for some reason replace every correct diacritical mark on the blog upon switching the language. Although articles are written using the correct marks (commas), they display as incorrect (cedillas) when switching the language to Romanian.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is pretty important, I hope you guys can fix this soon.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thank you and keep up the good work!
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;@westonruter if we go the non-linear route, what do you think about having the other changesets at the bottom of this panel? As shown in the attachment above.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol start="2"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Would we want to give the ability to edit/delete settings?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol start="3"&gt;&lt;li&gt;If I change the changeset to "save draft", what do you think about having the option to set the title show?

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Hello there! After looking into performance of the &lt;code&gt;wp_nav_menu&lt;/code&gt; function and possibilities of caching the nav menus, I came to the same conclusion as @spacedmonkey . Such a filter, as proposed in this ticket, could be used for effectively caching nav menu items in case persistent object caching is used.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There currently is no good way to cache the nav menus, unless breaking classes indicating current page and it's ancestors when caching the final output.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What could be done in order to keep this ticket moving?
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
In terms of &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12734" title="#12734: defect (bug): Nav Menus don't scale for big sites (closed: fixed)"&gt;#12734&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a class="changeset" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/14560" title="Don't prime menu item cache if a persistent cache is being used. Prime ..."&gt;r14560&lt;/a&gt; have been introduced. However, while the commit message says following:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Don't prime menu item cache if a persistent cache is being used. Prime the menu item cache only on the first call to wp_get_nav_menu_items(). Avoids unneeded queries when wp_get_nav_menu_items() is called repeatedly. see &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12734" title="#12734: defect (bug): Nav Menus don't scale for big sites (closed: fixed)"&gt;#12734&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The code introduced in the revision says following:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;// Get all posts and terms at once to prime the caches
if ( empty($fetched[$menu-&amp;gt;term_id]) || $_wp_using_ext_object_cache ) {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The condition check for whether the currently processed &lt;code&gt;term_id&lt;/code&gt; has already been fetched (eg.: during repeated call to &lt;code&gt;wp_nav_menu&lt;/code&gt;) by checking for the key in static variable &lt;code&gt;$fetched&lt;/code&gt; or whether external object cache is in use.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The, imho, faulty part of the condition is the &lt;code&gt;|| $_wp_using_ext_object_cache&lt;/code&gt; (or currently used &lt;code&gt;|| wp_using_ext_object_cache()&lt;/code&gt;) as it says, prime caches always, in case external object cache is being used.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The conditional, imho, should state &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp; ! wp_using_ext_object_cache()&lt;/code&gt;. Testing this change on a WordPress install without persistent object cache backend shows no difference in behaviour (as expected), and testing the change on the same WordPress install after enabling persistent object cache backend shows decrease in the number of SQL queries performed by &lt;code&gt;wp_nav_menu&lt;/code&gt; call.
&lt;/p&gt;

I just tested it and it doesn't look like it fixed $40177. I'll try to write a test case for it and see if I can cover that too.

&lt;p&gt;
I tried the patch to no avail:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That patch is for pages (and other hierarchial post types), not for taxonomies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I've created a workaround plugin to preserve hierarchy for both post types and taxonomies:
&lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/18282/preserve-page-and-taxonomy-hierarchy.php" title="Attachment 'preserve-page-and-taxonomy-hierarchy.php' in Ticket #18282"&gt;preserve-page-and-taxonomy-hierarchy.php&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/18282/preserve-page-and-taxonomy-hierarchy.php" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Note that it only affects "View All" tab, not "Most Recent" or "Most Used".
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So where do we add this file to?
&lt;/p&gt;

@torndownunits did the temp fix work for WC ? it's not working for me.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yes, I used the plugin from post &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25" title="#25: defect (bug): Missing http:// with website for user profile (closed: fixed)"&gt;#25&lt;/a&gt;.   It's not ideal but it makes the Product Categories hierarchy at least display correctly in Appearance--&amp;gt; Menus (using View All) which is what I needed.  It was a mess before, and now the hierarchy of everything is at least correct.  Using the editor with dozens (never mind hundreds) of items is a pain still, but I can use it.    Also, I ended up here from your posts at Woo.   But isn't this a problem with all items in the Menu editor, not just Woo items?  The editor basically is just horrible when dealing with dozens (never mind hundreds) of options in general.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
woocommerce (mikejolley) said they could fix it but i was the only one complaining about it. they need more ppl reporting it so they take the time to fix it. plz, ask them to fix this bug or it never going to be fixed :(.

It still needs some more unit tests around the mapping part.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thanks for the patch, I think my other ticket is related to this ticket... &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40177" title="#40177: defect (bug): sidebars_widgets option is not updated after activating a theme on ... (closed: duplicate)"&gt;#40177&lt;/a&gt;
Maybe the patch will fix both tickets.

remove_wp_meta_box
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We added in a new setting in v5.5.13 allowing the default WP custom field metabox to be removed. Although simple, this can drastically speed up the load times of the post edit page! From Advanced Custom Fields version 5.6.0, this setting will be set to true by default. If you require access to this metabox and don’t mind the extra load time, you can always change this setting via the acf/settings filter.

The above are before/afters if &lt;code&gt;die()&lt;/code&gt; were replaced by &lt;code&gt;wp_die()&lt;/code&gt; in the terse case, eg
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;wp_die( '&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;' . __( 'Error establishing a database connection' ) . '&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;', __( 'Database Error' ) );

      <title>Ticket #41661 (Using proxy &amp; HTTP 1.1 leads to full URL in REQUEST_URI variable in Apache) created</title>
      
        <dc:creator>olygraph</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Thu, 17 Aug 2017 15:29:38 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/41661</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/41661/1502983778272477</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
When using a proxy the browser send a full URL in var REQUEST_URI
$_SERVER&lt;a class="missing wiki"&gt;REQUEST_URI?&lt;/a&gt;;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
i.e.:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With proxy: it returns &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://mydomain.com/requestedurl"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://mydomain.com/requestedurl&lt;/a&gt;
No Proxy: it returns /requestedurl
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Solution:
check the variable to see if it is full path and transform it:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$_SERVER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'REQUEST_URI'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;requesturl_format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$_SERVER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'HTTP_HOST'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$_SERVER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'REQUEST_URI'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;requesturl_format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$m_host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$m_request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$m_regex&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;sprintf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'#(https?://)(%s)(/.*)#'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$m_host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

After upgrading from 4.8 to 4.8.1 the custom fields meta box disappeared from regular post editor. It is not listed when looking in screen options. Rolling back to 4.8 returns the box.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Maybe your memory_limit is to low. Have you enabled WP_DEBUG?
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://codex.wordpress.org/WP_DEBUG"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://codex.wordpress.org/WP_DEBUG&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It's important to check, if its caused by WP Core. So you have to change to a default theme and deactivate all your plugins. You can make a local copy of your installation, so you don't have to do it on the live page.
&lt;/p&gt;

Probably in this cases it's a bug in the theme and not of WordPress, you have to check the error log for any php errors.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Yeah, we can do this. We have plenty of other files with a similar purpose (ie, the entire content of the &lt;a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/tests/phpunit/tests/functions"&gt;functions folder&lt;/a&gt;) that manage to convey their purpose without using underscores.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There doesn't appear to be any particular standard for naming test files, but it looks like camelCase is the most common, so I'm cool with using that.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Hi I am using a gabfire theme to run my site www.bamendaonline.net recently when I try to access my widget page under appearance it returns a complete blank page. I have uninstall most of my plugins and nothing seems to change. I don't know where I have gone wrong or if its a problem with the latest version of wordpress. This is one of the message I get when I use F12 on my brower "Failed to load resource: "the server responded with a status of 500 (Internal Server Error)" Thanks
&lt;/p&gt;

They are functions not classes but probably is missing that part in the docs :-)

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I think that they are an exception because they are all name of functions of WordPress.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Don't think that's a valid enough reason. :)
Especially when we explicitly say the following for classes:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Class file names should be based on the class name with class- prepended and the &lt;strong&gt;underscores in the class name replaced with hyphens&lt;/strong&gt;, for example WP_Error becomes: class-wp-error.php
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I think that they are an exception because they are all name of functions of WordPress.
&lt;/p&gt;

The following list of Core phpunit tests have underscores in their name, which is against &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/php/#naming-conventions"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;WP's file naming convention&lt;/a&gt; (which we enforce in our own repo, so I cannot import them).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;trunk/tests/phpunit/tests/filesystem/find_folder.php
trunk/tests/phpunit/tests/hooks/add_filter.php

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Would it be possible to have them renamed with hyphens instead of underscores?
&lt;/p&gt;

That's a bug in the TGMPA library, not core. It has already been fixed, see &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/41644" title="#41644: defect (bug): Error in multiple install plugins (closed: invalid)"&gt;#41644&lt;/a&gt;.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I used TGM plugin to install two plugins. And after installing the plugin, I found 1 warning in wp-admin/includes/class-bulk-upgrader-skin.php on line 154.
I checked the code and found the following code there.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
                         &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                                &lt;span class="k"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'&amp;lt;div class="updated js-update-details" data-update-details="progress-'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;esc_attr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;upgrader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;update_current&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'"&amp;gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
                                        &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;sprintf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;upgrader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;strings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'skin_update_successful'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$title&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
                                        &lt;span class="s1"&gt;' &amp;lt;button type="button" class="hide-if-no-js button-link js-update-details-toggle" aria-expanded="false"&amp;gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Show details.'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;

                        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I have attached a screenshot of the error here too.

Hey!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here's a solution I came up with:
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/junaidbhura/wp-image"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://github.com/junaidbhura/wp-image&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There's a working prototype to solve this problem.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'd love to hear what you think!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thanks @swissspidy for pointing me to this ticket!

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Hi Guys,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I was already having an alert validation in my Gravity form using JQuery JS, It really works before on the past/previous, but after I update my wordpress version it's no longer working. The Alert is showing up and working fine but after all is good the form will no longer submit it seems it's freeze.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This code is a sample JQuery I use on my Gravity Form:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;// JavaScript Document
jQuery(document).ready(function(){
   jQuery("#gform_submit_button_2").click(function(){
 	var email = jQuery("#input_2_1").val();
  	if(email == '') { alert('Email Address is Empty.'); return false; }
    });
  });
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Again that code is working before and the Gravity Form was really submit after all validation is good, Hope you can find a solution for this Guys.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thanks
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #41655 (Enable dead_db() to be trappable always.) created</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
It would be handy if &lt;code&gt;dead_db()&lt;/code&gt; could be made trappable always, either through using &lt;code&gt;wp_die()&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;die()&lt;/code&gt; in the terse case, or via a filter.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It currently causes WP-CLI (see &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/4303"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/4303&lt;/a&gt;) to resort to a brittle hack in order to trap database connection errors.

      <description>&lt;i&gt;Keywords&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It would be best to put this in &lt;code&gt;wpdb::bail()&lt;/code&gt;. That method will always be the one called when WPDB needs to kill page loading. There's no need to check &lt;code&gt;WP_DEBUG &amp;amp;&amp;amp; WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY&lt;/code&gt; here, as &lt;code&gt;wpdb::$show_errors&lt;/code&gt; is set to that.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I would suggest appending it to &lt;code&gt;$message&lt;/code&gt; at the start. Also, don't forget to check &lt;code&gt;mysqli_error()&lt;/code&gt;. :-)
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #39896 (Customizer: Allow users to Draft changes before Publishing) updated</title>
      
        <dc:creator>westonruter</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Thu, 17 Aug 2017 01:12:02 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39896#comment:22</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39896#comment:22/1502932322704316</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
One other thing that I think needs to be factored into this design is how to display any existing changesets which are currently scheduled or other changesets that are currently drafted. Or do we only allow one single changeset to be drafted/scheduled at a time for the first iteration on a core merge? This is the so-called “linear option”. In that option, when you open the Customizer you would be opening with whatever the latest non-published changeset is, whether that be drafted or scheduled.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For the non-linear option (the branching option), which is what Customize Snapshots implements, there can be any number of concurrent changesets drafted or scheduled at a time, and in that case each time you open the Customizer you'd be starting a new changeset. In that case, you'd want to be able to get a list of other changesets drafts or scheduled for publishing to open for additional edits.
&lt;/p&gt;
