      <title>Ticket #39716 (Improve update_meta_cache's performance when called with one object ID) created</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
When update_meta_cache is called with only one object ID, the SQL statement using "WHERE $column IN ($id_list)" is not optimized and could be much faster as "WHERE $column=$id_list".
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I'm +1 for this. Merging a pristine copy of PHPMailer and not having to remove features for security updates is beneficial for all.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I can see arguments for keeping our current "slimmed down" version, as 99.99% of sites never use some of the functions we currently ship with (SMTP for example, or the SMTP authentication methods), but the fact it's not an official upstream version we can copy-paste irks me, and isn't good for security/file modification scanners.
&lt;/p&gt;

The majority of plugins included their own copy in order to include it period. It was merely an educational issue that caused that situation. The point of this ticket is that those who have a legit reason for the un-forked version of the library should not be excluded and put more at risk :)
&lt;/p&gt;

By default the customizer will store the customized state in a &lt;code&gt;customize_changeset&lt;/code&gt; post that gets an &lt;code&gt;auto-draft&lt;/code&gt; status so that it will be garbage-collected after a week. Whenever the changeset is updated, the &lt;code&gt;post_date&lt;/code&gt; should be updated to the current datetime so that it will be kept-alive for another week (see &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39713" title="#39713: defect (bug): Customize: Changeset post_date does not bump when an auto-draft is updated (closed: fixed)"&gt;#39713&lt;/a&gt;). However, when new page/post stubs are created via nav menus (&lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/34923" title="#34923: enhancement: Allow users to more seamlessly create page-based nav menus during ... (closed: fixed)"&gt;#34923&lt;/a&gt;) or via starter content (&lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38114" title="#38114: task (blessed): Make it easier to visualize where to put your content in a given theme ... (closed: fixed)"&gt;#38114&lt;/a&gt;) these are also inserted with the &lt;code&gt;auto-draft&lt;/code&gt; status. Whenever the changeset is updated and its &lt;code&gt;post_date&lt;/code&gt; is bumped, the &lt;code&gt;post_date&lt;/code&gt; for each of the auto-draft &lt;code&gt;nav_menus_created_posts&lt;/code&gt; also needs to be correspondingly bumped. Currently such page/post stubs can be deleted out from under the changeset prematurely.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Additionally, if &lt;code&gt;customize_changeset&lt;/code&gt; is transitioned to a stable &lt;code&gt;draft&lt;/code&gt; status so that it will not be garbage-collected, any auto-draft &lt;code&gt;nav_menus_created_posts&lt;/code&gt; should have the &lt;code&gt;post_date&lt;/code&gt; bumped to be very far in the future so that they will always be ignored by &lt;code&gt;wp_delete_auto_drafts()&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Lastly, when a &lt;code&gt;customize_changeset&lt;/code&gt; post is deleted without having been published, all auto-draft &lt;code&gt;nav_menus_created_posts&lt;/code&gt; should be deleted as well.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Seems like it is worth doing, with the number of SMTP or related plugins which did include their own version of PHPMailer.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Currently we're using a customized version of phpMailer that strips out some features. This is most evident when you compare class.smtp.php:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ours: &lt;a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/src/wp-includes/class-smtp.php#L465"&gt;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/src/wp-includes/class-smtp.php#L465&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Official: &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/blob/v5.2.21/class.smtp.php#L465-L527"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/blob/v5.2.21/class.smtp.php#L465-L527&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We're missing sections which plugin developers are using to support extended features (oauth, ntlm, etc). By leaving this out, we introduce a reason for them to include versions of PHPMailer which they then have to update in the case of security issues (such as the sort that predicated the 4.7.1 core release).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If we were to include the full library, it would be easier (and faster) for core to update in case of security issues, and it would provide more flexibility and security for plugins and (by extension) users of WordPress.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Thu, 26 Jan 2017 22:16:01 GMT</pubDate>

Replying to &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39087#comment:9" title="Comment 9"&gt;westonruter&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is a good first bug to get feet wet with customizer JS API. There is already a notification that displays when there are no widget areas in the preview, so the needed patch would extend that to show another notification when there are some widget areas sections that are not active.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'm trying to get that notification to show up using a custom page without widget areas but I'm unable to see it (shows up for a second when the customizer loads but disappears immediately), examples:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Custom page with zero widget areas: &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://cloudup.com/caQZhxkb4jf"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://cloudup.com/caQZhxkb4jf&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If I get rid of one of them only (the sidebar widget area) it shows correctly the remaining two: &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://cloudup.com/cSdT5Zxz4cp"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://cloudup.com/cSdT5Zxz4cp&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Maybe I'm misunderstanding the expected behavior?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If I'm on the right path we're looking at &lt;code&gt;src/wp-admin/js/customize-widgets.js&lt;/code&gt;, and the notification that should trigger when there are no widget areas in the preview is:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;'noAreasRendered'  =&amp;gt; __( 'There are no widget areas currently rendered in the preview. Navigate in the preview to a template that makes use of a widget area in order to access its widgets here.' ),
&lt;/pre&gt;</description>

By default the customizer will store the customized state in a &lt;code&gt;customize_changeset&lt;/code&gt; post that gets an &lt;code&gt;auto-draft&lt;/code&gt; status so that it will be garbage-collected after a week. In lieu of transitioning the changeset post to a &lt;code&gt;draft&lt;/code&gt; status (&lt;a class="new ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31089" title="#31089: enhancement: Customize: Add revisions for changesets (new)"&gt;#31089&lt;/a&gt;), the intention was that such changesets could be kept alive by simply making a modification every few days to keep their &lt;code&gt;post_date&lt;/code&gt; bumped so that it doesn't get a week stale and so by deleted by &lt;code&gt;wp_delete_auto_drafts()&lt;/code&gt;. This, however, is not working. Once an auto-draft changeset is created, its post date is not getting updated when updates are made to the post.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;WP_Locale_Switcher:: restore_current_locale()&lt;/code&gt; does exactly what &lt;code&gt;restore_site_state()&lt;/code&gt; does.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If we do end up with a switcher class, I don't think we need a fourth layer of API's around globals, objects, and procedures.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Also, the proposed patch here is kinda doing-it-wrong. Why create a local variable to encapsulate the states of a few globals when you can already look at the globals directly or avoid them procedurally?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the &lt;code&gt;get_site_state()&lt;/code&gt; function, a new &lt;code&gt;WP_Site_State&lt;/code&gt; object is created with each call, so we'd end up with many copies of those globals with different signatures in PHP that will consume an ever increasing amount of memory when used multiple times within the same scope.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think this is trying to solve a problem that doesn't exist, and introduces more complexity than it adds value.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Consider also that this patch is not a backwards compatible replacement for what's in core, because the &lt;code&gt;switch_blog&lt;/code&gt; action does not get fired on the way out of the iterator anymore, only at the beginning. And currently, the switched stack is only really ever 2 items deep, not several, though it's certainly possible to do so on your own.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Not gonna lie, it's gonna be hard to win me over on this one. :)
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #39712 (Improve wording of bulk delete warnings for media) created</title>
      
        <dc:creator>dllh</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Thu, 26 Jan 2017 21:47:22 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39712</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39712/1485467242361557</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
In &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/28235" title="#28235: defect (bug): No Warning for Bulk Media Deletions (closed: fixed)"&gt;#28235&lt;/a&gt;, we added a js alert when people attempt to bulk delete images. It's been helpful at reducing instances of uninformed bulk deletion, but I still see a fair few cases of people deleting without the understanding that deleting from the media library will also make images unavailable within posts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The warning currently lives in two places, one of which is filterable and one of which is not. The non-filterable one is the one that actually gets used on the media page, so while I'm happy to just filter the message on my install, it won't actually work. The message reads as follows:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You are about to permanently delete these items.\n  'Cancel' to stop, 'OK' to delete.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The warning is sufficiently dire about the deletion of the images, but if somebody doesn't understand that image removal will affect post content, it doesn't do them much good. Think about how you can embed an image in a Keynote presentation, delete the image from a folder on your hard drive, and it remains embedded in the Keynote without issue. I think that's the expectation some users have. If we can clarify that, I think we can avoid some data loss. I propose something like this:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You are about to permanently delete these items.\nDeleting the files permanently removes them from posts and pages on your site.\n  'Cancel' to stop, 'OK' to delete.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If that seems reasonable, I'm happy to work up a patch.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
For the dimensions, I think it makes sense to follow the format &lt;code&gt;200 by 200 pixels&lt;/code&gt; like ticket &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38932" title="#38932: defect (bug): Add unit (px) to suggested image size in customizer (closed: fixed)"&gt;#38932&lt;/a&gt; since we are planning to move forward with that format in 4.8 for suggested image dimensions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Does min reflect the time format 00:00:00 correctly? For example, if it was 1:02:00 it would have to read 62 min to be correct or change it to 1:02:00 hours. I think adding a unit for the time layout might be a little confusing.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Hello,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Before thinking of greater enhancement about plugin management for Multisite, I would like to bring this little enhancement :
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Allow network administrators (super admin by now) with the manage_network_plugins cap to network activate/deactivate/delete a plugin on the sub site plugin list table.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I just point the actions to the Network URL, so after an action is made, the user is automatically redirected to the network admin plugin page, by that, it's more easy for the admin to continue managing its network plugins if he want to do some bulk actions for example.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The only difficult point is for the Network Delete action, imagine you have a plugin which is activated in site 1 (and you're not aware of it), and you want to Delete a plugin on site 1 where this plugin is not installed, this could be dangerous. So maybe it's safer to drop this Delete action on single site. But maybe it's not so dangerous since you have the exact same behavior on Network Plugin list, you can delete a plugin which is activated on a sub site.
&lt;/p&gt;

Just weighing here that I think this is a good idea, and I think the change should be backported as well. At least across the versions we're still doing security updates for.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I agree with both of you :-)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Right now, &lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/37958/37958.patch" title="Attachment '37958.patch' in Ticket #37958"&gt;37958.patch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/37958/37958.patch" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt; is great when you want to switch to multiple blogs in a loop and want to easily go back to the pre-loop state in one step (&lt;code&gt;restore_site_state()&lt;/code&gt; in the patch).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Making individual switches suck less (e.g. easy to use stack, no globals) could be achieved by having a class similar to &lt;code&gt;WP_Locale_Switcher&lt;/code&gt;. That's where a base class makes sense.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It seems like one talks about the former, the other one about the latter. Why not have both?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Did you have a look at the patch? :)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don't see anything in storing and restoring a single (!) site state that really urges to be handled similar to stacking up locales.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are 4 methods for switching:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;switch_to_locale()&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;restore_previous_locale()&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;restore_current_locale()&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;change_locale()&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Or, in other words, what is it that you don't like in the current patch (and thus idea)?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I like the idea, because it's what the Locale switcher already does. I don't like the patch because states are already a named thing in WordPress, typically meaning a combination of statuses. While sites aren't filterable yet, they should be soon (see &lt;a class="assigned ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/37684" title="#37684: enhancement: Allow sites to have filterable &amp;#34;states&amp;#34; akin to posts &amp;amp; media (assigned)"&gt;#37684&lt;/a&gt;) and these names would conflict, creating more &amp;amp; different confusion.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It's also too ambiguous: &lt;code&gt;state&lt;/code&gt; could mean visibility, status, availability, or any combination there-of, but actually means none of those things in this implementation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Historically, what you're proposing is originally how the site-switching API worked (back in 2005) but as a whole we've decided long ago to always switch back to the current site as quickly as possible, for two reasons:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;maintain code clarity
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;not accidentally avoid actions or filters running deep in the stack (that might not be obvious in the current scope)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
We decided on &lt;code&gt;stack&lt;/code&gt; because that's how it works. It's an ordered array of sites in a stack, and you can traverse as deep into that stack (and back out again) as you'd like for your given purpose.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There isn't anything wrong with "stack" other than it being foreign, and since developers aren't exposed to the name of the globals, it doesn't even really effect anyone other than people working on core, which makes the overhead for re-learning a 10 year old API high with a low return value because we still need to maintain the old global incase someone touches it manually.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Phew!
&lt;/p&gt;

It looks like nothing uses it, but it might be used by anyone who might be extending the class. I don't see any harm in keeping it in there for those purposes, but otherwise, it could be removed.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
As far as I can tell, &lt;code&gt;WP_Media_List_Table::column_desc()&lt;/code&gt; never gets called by anything in Core. It doesn't look like there's ever been a &lt;code&gt;Description&lt;/code&gt; column in that table.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think it was just accidentally added when the table was broken out into it's own file (&lt;code&gt;list-table-media.php&lt;/code&gt; at the time) from &lt;code&gt;default-list-tables.php&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;a class="changeset" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/15491" title="Ajaxify list-type screens in the admin. See #14579"&gt;r15491&lt;/a&gt;. It might go back even further, but that's when I stopped digging :)

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I don't mean to complain but this getting pushed back keeps breaking the mission critical part of one of my sites. Without the custom RSS feed I created iTunes, Stitcher, etc... can't find my new episodes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I just wanted to put in that info hoping that a quick resolution can be done so that others don't have the same issue. In my opinion this should be treated as an issue breaking mission critical processes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Do we know if any of these patches work with 4.7.2? I can check on it locally later but if someone knows it would be helpful.
&lt;/p&gt;

This would also be incorporated into the customizer visual editing as well. So users could see the image in the sidebar before publishing?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yes. The user would see the image not only in the TinyMCE editor in the sidebar widget control but also in the preview as well as it would appear on the site (in a widget area) once the changes are published.

      <title>Ticket #39709 (Add filler content to New Site Registration email to avoid space ratio ...) created</title>
      
        <dc:creator>iandunn</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Thu, 26 Jan 2017 19:57:08 GMT</pubDate>

      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39709/1485460628504226</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I noticed SpamAssassin on helpscout.net is coming very close to flagging the &lt;code&gt;New Site Registration&lt;/code&gt; emails as spam.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The biggest rule being triggered is &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/Rules/TVD_SPACE_RATIO"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;`TVD_SPACE_RATIO_MINFP`&lt;/a&gt;, with a weight of &lt;code&gt;2.5&lt;/code&gt;, getting the message 50% of the way to the the default threshold of &lt;code&gt;5&lt;/code&gt;. That rule looks for excessive whitespace in the message body, and I'm guessing it's being triggered by the high ratio of newlines to paragraph text. I uploaded &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://pastebin.com/tDyEfShL"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;a pastebin with the full headers and body&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don't have time right now to verify whether or not helpscout.net is using the default SpamAssassin configuration, or if they've weighted this rule more heavily for some reason, but even if they have, it seems likely that others will as well. Additionally, the current message text seems like poor UX, and I think the fix for the spam issue would also fix that.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think the fix would be to add some filler text to the message body, to decrease the ratio of newlines to paragraph text. e.g.:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Howdy, this is your WordPress multisite installation at {example.org}. I thought you'd like to know that a new site was created. The details are below:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It doesn't really matter what the text is, as long as it's a normal sentence or two, so whatever makes the most sense from a UX point of view will probably be fine.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If the new text does include the domain name, I think we should avoid entering a full URL, because that could trigger other spam rules. (As an aside, I think it's generally a bad idea to include URLs in emails, since it trains users to expect and click them, which makes them more vulnerable to phishing. That's another ticket, though.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think the next steps for this ticket would be:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reproduce the issue with a local SpamAssassin instance, to verify that &lt;code&gt;2.5&lt;/code&gt; is the default score for this message (rather than something Help Scout modified)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Test that adding some filler text will prevent the rule from being triggered. I don't think it'll really matter what the text is, for the purposes of testing.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Decide on what the best text would be from a UX perspective
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
This would be such a huge win for people who put a lot of media in their sidebar.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The vast majority of users I have seen use &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://en-ca.wordpress.org/plugins/black-studio-tinymce-widget/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;Black Studio's famous Visual Editor&lt;/a&gt; just for image placement alone. This widget would remove that extra step work around that a lot of users don't know about and "I wish I knew this six months ago" I have heard more then a few times would also be reduced.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This would also be incorporated into the customizer visual editing as well. So users could see the image in the sidebar before publishing?
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Hi @alwaysbrightblue thanks for posting this after the discussion in #design Slack today. I am still a little confused if you mean this to be a ticket to move to a solution for on boarding. I think that's what you want, so let me assume that - correct me if I'm wrong.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The problem that is trying to be solved is how designers and developers create solutions related to issues with user-experience. Without onboarding documentation how do we know what the WP dev community expectation is for a WP set-up? How do you know what to focus on for issues around setup of a new install? How do you establish priority on UX problems?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think there's a wider and more focused approach here. You ask a lot of wider questions, forgive me for focusing in a bit as I think that's sensible to find a route through this ticket. Wider, I think we all agree we need to have better research and we're working on it. I think what you are suggesting is a focus on on boarding here though, I think it's a good first focus for your efforts there and aligns with what others have indicated they want to do. It also aligns with real user issues.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The tracs for [UX-feedback](&lt;a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/tickets/ux-feedback"&gt;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/tickets/ux-feedback&lt;/a&gt;) do not show a document outlining the basic onboarding experience of a new WP user. It seems there are assumptions about onboarding, but no documentation exists. Therefore, expectations of a user setting up WP are all assumptions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The ux-feedback trac tag would probably not be the right place for such a document to exist. I'd probably say the handbook. You are right though, there is no document outlining flows for this. Although, I would say that documentation and any flows would be linked to a solution. So just having them doesn't get there.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For example, there are currently discussions about the Customizer and the Editor on Slack. From what I can tell, the discussions are looking to implement features to ease the setup process and future editing of WP. As a designer, I am having trouble understanding why these areas have been identified as pain points. Are users not using WP as expected? In the WP Design Handbook, there is no documentation around onboarding (&lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://make.wordpress.org/design/handbook/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://make.wordpress.org/design/handbook/&lt;/a&gt;), so I have no basis from which to understand what "standard" onboarding results are versus "edge-case" onboarding results. I would more easily be able to participate in contributing if I understand the baseline expectations of users by the development community.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A few things to answer here, good points. I think its important to focus a little as you are panning out into wider issues and then back to on boarding. I would to give you some context provide some links here that cover some background:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://make.wordpress.org/design/2017/01/13/what-makes-a-great-customization-experience/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;What makes a great customisation experience: some really insightful feedback there&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/01/04/focus-tech-and-design-leads/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;The announcement of the focuses: to give some context&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I also
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
An excellent source of documenting the onboarding is being posted here &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://make.wordpress.org/design/2017/01/18/share-a-walkthrough-of-setting-up-a-wordpress-site/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://make.wordpress.org/design/2017/01/18/share-a-walkthrough-of-setting-up-a-wordpress-site/&lt;/a&gt; These examples are from experienced users, which would be one segment of the user base. Even from these users, we see variation in setup. Which would be considered "normal" and therefore fulfilling the expectations of the developers?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Not all examples there hopefully will be from experienced users. I think we have to see what results we get back there and I do agree though we need to look at all levels. I'd strongly encourage you to run some test yourself - it's incredibly insightful to do so.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Without this documentation, it is challenging to align designers and developers on resolving user experience. I hope by establishing documentation around onboarding, the community's expectations of users are aligned. When exceptions to the onboarding occur, it will be more identifiable as an edge-case.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We can all get this process started without overthinking it. Keep it simple by drawing user-flowcharts. Contribute to the "Share a walkthrough" post. If you alreay have user expectations, please share! If you already have documentation of expected user flows for WP, please share!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thanks for your time!

&lt;p&gt;
We'd love to find a better name, but currently we don't have a better idea.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I like blogmeta. If it were up to me the two terms in use would just be &lt;code&gt;blogs&lt;/code&gt; (entries in the &lt;code&gt;wp_blogs&lt;/code&gt; table) and &lt;code&gt;networks&lt;/code&gt; (entries in the &lt;code&gt;wp_sites&lt;/code&gt; table, which would ideally be renamed &lt;code&gt;wp_networks&lt;/code&gt;), and we'd entirely avoid the now-rather-ambiguous term &lt;code&gt;sites&lt;/code&gt; (I always need to double-check what that means, especially seeing how I only deal with multisite stuff periodically). But that's a bit off-topic.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So that plan sounds good to me!
&lt;/p&gt;

                 *
                 * Note: If using conditional tags, use the method versions within the passed instance
                 * (e.g. $this-&amp;gt;is_main_query() instead of is_main_query()). This is because the functions
                 * like is_main_query() test against the global $wp_query instance, not the passed one.

                &lt;span class="nx"&gt;do_action_ref_array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'pre_get_posts'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$this&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Shorthand.
&lt;/span&gt;                &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$q&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;query_vars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I'm proposing that, just like we have &lt;code&gt;$q['suppress_filters']&lt;/code&gt; that we add a &lt;code&gt;$q['suppress_actions']&lt;/code&gt; to prevent actions like &lt;code&gt;pre_get_posts&lt;/code&gt; from running (which is essentially a filter) on my query (if I want).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We could also apply &lt;code&gt;$q['suppress_filters']&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;pre_get_posts&lt;/code&gt; action since the user can modify the query since it's passed by reference, and may not create another argument, but it is not really a filter.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'm not sure how this idea could be problematic, nor can I think of any reason why we couldn't do anything like this, but I thought I'd at least open it up for discussion and see what becomes of it. I guess my question really is why can I suppress filters but not actions?
&lt;/p&gt;

While this is somewhat related to the customizer project for setting up an install, a general user flowchart should be created.

@nikeo it's hard to read the diff since it looks like you're using spaces but core uses tabs. Could you refresh?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Also, similar to &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/33428" title="#33428: defect (bug): Toggling customizer controls based on another control does not work ... (closed: fixed)"&gt;#33428&lt;/a&gt; I'd like to know what the core use case would be for this. How would core be improved with this change? If not, then perhaps it should remain plugin territory. You can have a plugin that extends/wraps &lt;code&gt;wp.customize.Value.prototype&lt;/code&gt; with the new methods and modified methods to start feedback from plugin developers.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;refactor unit tests using dataProvider
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;only remove the tailing &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; after an HTML comment when the paragraph starts as a comment
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
*adjust the regex for adding breaks after comments - exclude cases where a closing &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; tag is already present
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
all of the formatting group unit tests now pass. appreciate testing &amp;amp; feedback.

In my case it was issue with www
as soon as I removed www, it started working...
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Although I also WP Super Cache, But WP Super was not culprit in my case..

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
In a similar fashion, the &lt;code&gt;delete_{$meta_type}_meta&lt;/code&gt; could have the &lt;code&gt;$delete_all&lt;/code&gt; param added.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
The hooks &lt;code&gt;add_{$meta_type}_meta&lt;/code&gt; and similar provide context about &lt;code&gt;$object_id&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;$meta_key&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;$_meta_value&lt;/code&gt; and such, but do not tell whether the meta data added or updated is supposed to be &lt;code&gt;$unique&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Adding this information could be helpful. My use case for instance is propagating meta data across posts.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #39705 (Reverse the order in which the Travis jobs run) created</title>
      
        <dc:creator>johnbillion</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Thu, 26 Jan 2017 17:08:08 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39705</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39705/1485450488983587</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
The Travis jobs within a build run in the order in which they're specified in &lt;code&gt;.travis.yml&lt;/code&gt;. This means that the WordPress tests run on the oldest version of PHP first (5.2) and the newest version last (7.1). As a &lt;em&gt;general rule&lt;/em&gt;, this means the slowest test jobs run first because each subsequent version of PHP is faster than the previous.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This order should be reversed so that when a committer is patiently waiting for a Travis build to complete, they are at least more likely to see unexpected failures earlier than they otherwise would.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The disadvantage is that 5.2-specific failures would take longer to appear, but these are relatively infrequent.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
To kick some life in this ticket:
If you add an image with a caption to the content in visual mode and copy/paste it to another spot in the content, the caption text is copied but no longer inside the caption shortcode and associated with the image.
See for YouTube demo: &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://youtu.be/Dkg9oQHsaNQ"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://youtu.be/Dkg9oQHsaNQ&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Is this a bug or just not possible cc @azaozz / @iseulde

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
There are reports coming in via Slack that this caused issues with plugins that weren't prepared to correctly handle the newer, quality-controlled return values. After a quick chat, I'm reopening this so we can: revert this to stop that plugin breakage, and look into a better solution in 4.8 or beyond.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #39704 (Consider returning pagination headers on out-of-bounds requests) created</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Since &lt;a class="reopened ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39061" title="#39061: enhancement: REST API pagination: Large INT passed to `paged` query arg doesn't ... (reopened)"&gt;#39061&lt;/a&gt; in 39967 we return an error if the request is for a page number that does not exist (because there are not enough results). In 4.7 we instead sent the pagination headers along with an empty array as the return (with no error).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It's feasible that the pagination information would still be useful in the case of an out of bounds error, so maybe we should add the headers back.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
This is interesting. Good find.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I can't think of a problem with this, other than someone doing something weird that would still require the &lt;code&gt;$wp_did_header&lt;/code&gt; check.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Hi,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If in the reading settings of the site, i chose to list my latest posts as the home page: going on &lt;code&gt;wp-signup.php&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;wp-activate.php&lt;/code&gt; will query &amp;amp; fetch the 10 latests posts for nothing in a way. Moreover In this case &lt;code&gt;is_home()&lt;/code&gt; is true which is a bit confusing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If in the reading settings of the site, i chose a static front page as the home page, it will be requested and fetched when going on &lt;code&gt;wp-signup.php&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;wp-activate.php&lt;/code&gt;. In this case &lt;code&gt;is_page()&lt;/code&gt; is true which is less confusing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So i guess, the particularity of these two specific pages is they're getting the header and the footer of the active theme.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But i wonder why running &lt;code&gt;wp()&lt;/code&gt; ?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
By simply directly loading the &lt;code&gt;wp-includes/template-loader.php&lt;/code&gt; it can save a query.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
see signup-activate-1.patch
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If running &lt;code&gt;wp()&lt;/code&gt; is required for a reason i don't see, a query could still be saved and it could be interested to use this to set a "page" title for the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
see signup-activate-2.patch
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Ticket #38947 (Proposition to add an optimized api.Events manager to the api.Value ...) updated</title>
      
        <dc:creator>nikeo</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Thu, 26 Jan 2017 14:45:11 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38947#comment:3</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38947#comment:3/1485441911814429</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Two methods have been added to the api.Value constructor
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;trigger&lt;/code&gt; which triggers the bound callbacks of a specific topic, or trigger the anonymous callbacks
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;unbindAll&lt;/code&gt; which unbinds all previously bound functions of a callbacks topic if specified or unbinds all functions if no topic is specified
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;bind&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;unbind&lt;/code&gt; methods have been adapted to the new event manager.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I've also proposed a new optional argument object to the &lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt; method that was not initially scoped in the proposition. The proposed argument allows us to "silently" set an &lt;code&gt;api.Value()&lt;/code&gt; instance, whithout firing the callbacks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This code ensures a backward compatibility with the current API, since it allows to bind an &lt;code&gt;api.Value&lt;/code&gt; both ways : with or without a topic id.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
While working on a plugin, I have discovered that wp_mail calls:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
\wp-includes\pluggable.php(453):
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$phpmailer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;AddAttachment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$attachment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Where the method in the class is...
\wp-includes\class-phpmailer(2506):
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;addAttachment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$encoding&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'base64'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$disposition&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'attachment'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I note that PHP function names are case insensitive:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Function names are case-insensitive, though it is usually good form to call functions as they appear in their declaration.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://php.net/manual/en/functions.user-defined.php"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;User-defined functions&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, this does not affect anything really, other than my OCD. Do with it as you will.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If your old theme only has one menu and your new theme only has one menu, just map them automatically
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If your old theme and new theme share a similar IDs or names, map them automatically
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If your old theme has more than one menu, or your new theme has more than one menu, map the menu in the first menu location in your old theme to the first menu location in the new theme.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This sounds accurate to me.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don't hate the name, I hate the entire concept. It brings an extra layer of complexity that stumps pretty much every new user I've ever seen work with WordPress, both in person and via user testing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Same. I think it's clear why it happened that way, but it's incredibly confusing for users.
&lt;/p&gt;

Closing this ticket as won't fix. Since opening this ticket the installed plugin screen has changed and the search box now supports an ajax search, as well as being more clearly labeled.

@LogixTree can you give some more details here? where are you searching that isn't debounced? I think this is already fixed?

      <description>&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Minor thing: do we need the separate &lt;code&gt;debounceSearch&lt;/code&gt; function? Can we just wrap &lt;code&gt;search&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;_.debounce()&lt;/code&gt; instead?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thanks for the feedback @batmoo.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We probably could just wrap &lt;code&gt;search&lt;/code&gt; with _.debounce. I like adding the &lt;code&gt;debouncedSearch&lt;/code&gt;method because its name makes it clear the function is debounced when you invoke it. Looking thru core for other debounce uses, I see we do it a bit both ways - sometimes creating a new named function and sometimes wrapping a function directly. I'll give it a try that way, will probably make for a smaller diff.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Currently it is possible to edit any user via the REST API when sending a request to &lt;code&gt;wp-json/wp/v2/users/&amp;lt;id&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, even when the user with that ID is not part of the current site. As discussed in multisite office-hours, this is not desired and considered a bug. Only users of the site where the route is accessed should be editable.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Managing users beyond a single site will only become available in a future release, and it will work differently than this.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #39700 (wpemoji code in wp header triggers tracking protection warnings in ...) created</title>
      
        <dc:creator>corvuscorax</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Thu, 26 Jan 2017 12:12:27 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39700</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39700/1485432747414744</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Recent publications about user agent tracking and privacy protection put more emphasis on possible misuse of the HTML &amp;lt;canvas&amp;gt; feature to track and identify individual web users and browsers between site accesses, capable to circumvent "do not track" attributes and features without the use of cookies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To defend against this kind of attacks, specific browser plugins like "canvas blocker" (&lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/canvasblocker/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/canvasblocker/&lt;/a&gt;) track API calls to browser features typically used for that kind of attacks and block and/or warn the user about the attempt to identify them. Similar features are integrated into browsers optimized for privacy enabled browsing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Javascript code in the wpemoji header, inserted into all wordpress generated pages unless suppressed, utilises these same canvas API methods and as such triggers warnings and alerts in some of these browser plugins when visiting a wordpress generated site.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
(example:)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;&amp;lt;link rel='dns-prefetch' href='//s.w.org' /&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;script type="text/javascript"&amp;gt;
			window._wpemojiSettings = {"baseUrl":"https:\/\/s.w.org\/images\/core\/emoji\/2.2.1\/72x72\/","ext":".png","svgUrl":"https:\/\/s.w.org\/images\/core\/emoji\/2.2.1\/svg\/","svgExt":".svg","source":{"concatemoji":"http:\/\/************\/wp-includes\/js\/wp-emoji-release.min.js?ver=4.7.1"}};
			!function(a,b,c){function d(a){var b,c,d,e,f=String.fromCharCode;if(!k||!k.fillText)return!1;switch(k.clearRect(0,0,j.width,j.height),k.textBaseline="top",k.font="600 32px Arial",a){case"flag":return k.fillText(f(55356,56826,55356,56819),0,0),!(j.toDataURL().length&amp;lt;3e3)&amp;amp;&amp;amp;(k.clearRect(0,0,j.width,j.height),k.fillText(f(55356,57331,65039,8205,55356,57096),0,0),b=j.toDataURL(),k.clearRect(0,0,j.width,j.height),k.fillText(f(55356,57331,55356,57096),0,0),c=j.toDataURL(),b!==c);case"emoji4":return k.fillText(f(55357,56425,55356,57341,8205,55357,56507),0,0),d=j.toDataURL(),k.clearRect(0,0,j.width,j.height),k.fillText(f(55357,56425,55356,57341,55357,56507),0,0),e=j.toDataURL(),d!==e}return!1}function e(a){var c=b.createElement("script");c.src=a,c.defer=c.type="text/javascript",b.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(c)}var f,g,h,i,j=b.createElement("canvas"),k=j.getContext&amp;amp;&amp;amp;j.getContext("2d");for(i=Array("flag","emoji4"),c.supports={everything:!0,everythingExceptFlag:!0},h=0;h&amp;lt;i.length;h++)c.supports[i[h]]=d(i[h]),c.supports.everything=c.supports.everything&amp;amp;&amp;amp;c.supports[i[h]],"flag"!==i[h]&amp;amp;&amp;amp;(c.supports.everythingExceptFlag=c.supports.everythingExceptFlag&amp;amp;&amp;amp;c.supports[i[h]]);c.supports.everythingExceptFlag=c.supports.everythingExceptFlag&amp;amp;&amp;amp;!c.supports.flag,c.DOMReady=!1,c.readyCallback=function(){c.DOMReady=!0},c.supports.everything||(g=function(){c.readyCallback()},b.addEventListener?(b.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",g,!1),a.addEventListener("load",g,!1)):(a.attachEvent("onload",g),b.attachEvent("onreadystatechange",function(){"complete"===b.readyState&amp;amp;&amp;amp;c.readyCallback()})),f=c.source||{},f.concatemoji?e(f.concatemoji):f.wpemoji&amp;amp;&amp;amp;f.twemoji&amp;amp;&amp;amp;(e(f.twemoji),e(f.wpemoji)))}(window,document,window._wpemojiSettings);
		&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;style type="text/css"&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Although this code's purpose seems to be to pre-cache the browsers features and capabilities for later use by the wp-emoji plugin, and as such these alerts are technically false positives,
the fact that they are read out on every page load regardless wether emoji features are being used, in combination with heavily obfuscated javascript code is bad practice.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
More so, this inserted code is nearly indistinguishable from a genuine tracking attempt and as such very prone to generate false positives.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is problematic, since the resulting alerts and warnings issued by the canvas API monitoring plugins compromise user trust in webpages using wordpress, and can also be a liability issue for website operators in regions where tracking methods are not permitted without prior consent by the user.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As such, I would highly suggest to modify this code to be less invasive, check capabilities only when they are actually needed, and avoid the pre-caching or browser capabilities, especially those of the canvas extension.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #39338 (class-wp-hook.php - apply_filters() infinite loop) updated</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Here is another incident with an infinite loop, from a different site.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This site runs WP 4.7.1.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A plugin (wordpress-backup-to-dropbox) gets interrupted by PHP's maximum execution time limit, and class-wp-hook.php goes bananas, just like plugin.php used to do in 4.6.1 (which, BTW, has had multiple incidents for multiple sites since the last time, but because the code has been fixed in 4.7, I haven't bothered reporting it as 4.6 won't be fixed, right?)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The plugin version is 4.5.3, the most recent is plugin version 4.7. Plugin version 4.7 introduces &lt;strong&gt;no code changes&lt;/strong&gt;, so that's irrelevant.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;
PHP Fatal error: Maximum execution time of 30 seconds exceeded in [...]/wp-content/plugins/wordpress-backup-to-dropbox/Classes/Processed/Files.php on line 40, referer: &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://[...]/wp-cron.php?doing_wp_cron="&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://[...]/wp-cron.php?doing_wp_cron=&lt;/a&gt;[...]

&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As previously noted by me, this is testable and reproducible.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
An alternative for reproducing is to make a dummy plugin that simply executes for longer than the regular max execution time, and then gets terminated by PHP.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But better yet, ensure that no loops depend on mistaken assumptions about guaranteed nice shutdown of plugins. Plugins may crash due to external circumstances. This particular "external" circumstance is PHP's execution time cap, but when running PHP under suphp or FastCGI or uWSGI or something else, there may be other things going on.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #39699 (Filter to check XML-RPC data before any DB insertion) created</title>
      
        <dc:creator>enrico.sorcinelli</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Thu, 26 Jan 2017 11:03:08 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39699</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39699/1485428588077709</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
After searching into XML-RPC server class code, I realized that it seems that there isn't way to check XML-RPC input data before starting to insert/update any rows to database nor to return an &lt;code&gt;IXR&lt;/code&gt; custom error message.
For example for new post, in order to check custom fields, a possible workaround is to use &lt;code&gt;wp_insert_post_empty_content&lt;/code&gt; filter, but we are unable to customize the error message. Moreover at this point some DB rows are inserted, so inside the filter above we have to call &lt;code&gt;wp_delete_post&lt;/code&gt; manually in order to clean DB (taking care to check &lt;code&gt;auto-draft&lt;/code&gt; post status).
In the case of editing post, things get a bit more complicated, so we could use transactions with the help of &lt;code&gt;xmlrpc_call&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;wp_insert_post&lt;/code&gt; actions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, the patch aims to add a new filter named &lt;code&gt;xmlrpc_before_insert_post&lt;/code&gt; that allows to do this check in a more robust manner (for &lt;code&gt;wp.newPost&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;wp.editPost&lt;/code&gt; XML-RCP methods).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Typical usage:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;defined&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'XMLRPC_REQUEST'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nx"&gt;add_filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'xmlrpc_before_insert_post'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'my_filter_xmlrpc_before_insert_post'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;my_filter_xmlrpc_before_insert_post&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$post_data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$content_struct&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$user&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// do checks with $post_data, i.e:
&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;title_contains_stop_words&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$post_data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'post_title'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;IXR_Error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;500&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Post title contains invalid words'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$post_data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The filter is placed inside &lt;code&gt;_insert_post&lt;/code&gt; helper function before &lt;code&gt;get_default_post_to_edit()&lt;/code&gt; that isthe first statement that adds a new DB row.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Regards
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
@mnelson4 Indeed that's what this table would be for. The name &lt;code&gt;blogmeta&lt;/code&gt; is only since &lt;code&gt;sitemeta&lt;/code&gt; is unfortunately already taken for network meta. We'd love to find a better name, but currently we don't have a better idea.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The data would probably be stored in one or the other table only. Our plan is to have the &lt;code&gt;*_option()&lt;/code&gt; functions check whether the requested option is in the whitelist for &lt;code&gt;blogmeta&lt;/code&gt; (only when multisite is activated of course) and choose the table depending on that. We'll have to be careful how we approach this though as we of course will also have a migration path to go, and it might happen that a &lt;code&gt;blogmeta&lt;/code&gt; option is not actually in that table just because it has not been migrated yet.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;code&gt;needs-unit-tests&lt;/code&gt; means some unit tests need to be written for this, not only running the existing tests. See the handbook for a &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/contribute/trac/keywords/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;list of all trac keywords&lt;/a&gt;. Let me know if I can help with that. I might have time to write tests myself next week.
&lt;/p&gt;

The correct capability might be &lt;code&gt;edit_post&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;read_post&lt;/code&gt;, but we'll see that with the unit test.

&lt;p&gt;
There's a lot of data from the old one that seems to be missing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don't see anything missing: title, slug, description, parent term are all there. There's even a delete button (see &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/9777" title="#9777: enhancement: Add &amp;#34;delete&amp;#34; button to term pages (closed: fixed)"&gt;#9777&lt;/a&gt;) and a count being displayed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don't see why we should rush into changing this particular UI to be uniform. UI uniformity makes sense if it's the same or similar thing. I am not sure this is.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The UI for editing single media items is similar too, even though it's not the same thing either.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As a user, I'd welcome a move to a more similar UI when editing terms, but that's just my two cents.
&lt;/p&gt;

This looks good and works well.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Minor thing: do we need the separate &lt;code&gt;debounceSearch&lt;/code&gt; function? Can we just wrap &lt;code&gt;search&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;_.debounce()&lt;/code&gt; instead?
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Been thinking what would work best. As this is going to be "pure JS" way to load the needed parts for the editor, skipping most (all?) PHP filters that are currently in class-wp-editor.php seems better. This will avoid interference from current plugins.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Instead of the PHP filters, we can fire custom jQuery events before initializing each editor instance, passing the settings. This will allow plugins to modify them similarly to using the PHP filters. To make it easier for the plugins, we would need to add another PHP filter or action to trigger loading of these scripts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The plan is to make another function similar to &lt;code&gt;wp_editor()&lt;/code&gt; which will either output the script tags or return the src and scripts as strings so they can be lazy-loaded (we still have to output the translations and the settings from PHP). Then on the JS side will have a small function to load the scripts and CSS (if not already loaded) then initialize the editor firing the above events.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;if ( current_user_can( $post_type_obj-&amp;gt;cap-&amp;gt;delete_posts ) ) {
// . . .
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Based on my next example &lt;em&gt;delete_posts&lt;/em&gt; is null when it reaches this line of code.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Specifically this happens if a new post type is created only with just create_posts as capabilities.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here are the arguments of my post type.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="nx"&gt;add_action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'init'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$args&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'public'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'label'&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Books'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'publicly_queryable'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'exclude_from_search'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'capabilities'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'create_posts'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;register_post_type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'book'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$args&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I think &lt;em&gt;capabilities&lt;/em&gt;, argument should have a default value for &lt;em&gt;delete_posts&lt;/em&gt; and any other value that is expected on a post_type.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #39697 (Option in Settings to Disable Password Reset Notifications) created</title>
      
        <dc:creator>s3w47m88</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Thu, 26 Jan 2017 04:17:46 GMT</pubDate>

      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39697/1485404266854528</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I would like to request an option in WordPress Settings &amp;gt; General to disable Password Reset notifications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I am willing to write the code and submit the patch for this if I can get authorization to do so.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I believe this is necessary and should be in Core because it's not increasing the security of WordPress by notifying the site owner every time this is done, and unless the author actually needs this it's otherwise unnecessary tax on the server's mail system.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thank you for your consideration!
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #39696 (REST API: Filter which links get embedded when passing the ?_embed ...) created</title>
      
        <dc:creator>rheinardkorf</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Wed, 25 Jan 2017 23:06:58 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39696</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39696/1485385618947611</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
When performing a REST API request and adding the &lt;strong&gt;?_embed&lt;/strong&gt; query parameter the API attempts to embed all resources that is linked with &lt;strong&gt;embeddable&lt;/strong&gt; set to true.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In some cases we may need to only embed some resources, not all embeddable resources. I am requesting that the feature be added to allow the filtering of a resources when specifying the _embed parameter.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Example:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;http://&amp;lt;site&amp;gt;/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/48?_embed=author,wp:term
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If implemented, the above request should only embed the Author and the Terms.  (note that in this example : will be encoded to %3A)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Starting point:&lt;/strong&gt;
This can be implemented on the WP_REST_Server class and is likely to effect the following methods:
response_to_data, embed_links
&lt;/p&gt;

@theMikeD I was going by the screenshot as said here: &lt;a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/36574/edit-term-new.png"&gt;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/36574/edit-term-new.png&lt;/a&gt;. If there have been changes, great can you post up another screenshot?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don't see why we should rush into changing this particular UI to be uniform. UI uniformity makes sense if it's the same or similar thing. I am not sure this is.
&lt;/p&gt;

Typo edit: The &lt;strong&gt;curl&lt;/strong&gt; example shouldn't have any &lt;strong&gt;laextra.test&lt;/strong&gt; references so just read them as &lt;strong&gt;wordpress.test&lt;/strong&gt;.

Replying to &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/36574#comment:6" title="Comment 6"&gt;karmatosed&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's a lot of data from the old one that seems to be missing. I totally get that it could be available through screen options or showing. But, the point is not having at the top seems to not make so much sense.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Not sure what you mean by "a lot of data." Can you be more specific about the missing info? Name/slug/parent/description are all there.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Terms and posts are different things. What evidence (from users for example) do we have that they should have the same interface?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'm not married to this specific interface either, but it is a step in the right direction. And it's tough to answer a question that has never been asked. I don't think WP does focus groups for UX does it? If they do I'd love to be involved in that.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think UI uniformity (or at least similarity) is a laudable goal. FWIW I would love to see a rich text editor for the term description here as well, not just a simple text editor.
&lt;/p&gt;

http2 push enabled servers can immediately push linked assets or documents for the client. This saves clients from one round-trip.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At the moment at least Cloudflare and h2o web server can http2 server push assets defined in Link headers: &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/preload/#server-push-http-2"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://www.w3.org/TR/preload/#server-push-http-2&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I believe more will follow in the next few years. WordPress powers so much of the web that it's our responsibility to try to make it as fast as we can.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is usually quite hard topic because we have no idea what is stored in the client browser cache.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We can start implementing the Link preload headers in internal redirects because in that situation it's quite obvious that the client wants to make that request as their next one.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is what I want to achieve
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;$ curl --http2 -i https://wordpress.test/wp-admin/
HTTP/2 302
...
Location: https://laextra.test/wp-login.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Flaextra.test%2Fwp-admin%2F&amp;amp;reauth=1
Link: &amp;lt;/wp-login.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Flaextra.test%2Fwp-admin%2F&amp;amp;reauth=1&amp;gt;; rel=preload; as=document
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I created a patch which adds these headers automatically in &lt;strong&gt;wp_redirect()&lt;/strong&gt; function.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

      <description>&lt;i&gt;Keywords&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If the changes suggested are edit-term-new.png I have a few things to raise.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's a lot of data from the old one that seems to be missing. I totally get that it could be available through screen options or showing. But, the point is not having at the top seems to not make so much sense.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Terms and posts are different things. What evidence (from users for example) do we have that they should have the same interface?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

I don't hate the name, I hate the entire concept. It brings an extra layer of complexity that stumps pretty much every new user I've ever seen work with WordPress, both in person and via user testing.

Switching themes will cause widgets to be "lost" in theme switch.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This was previously fixed in &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/17979" title="#17979: task (blessed): Avoid losing widgets when switching themes (closed: fixed)"&gt;#17979&lt;/a&gt; for 3.3, sounds like there was a regression somewhere.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you go from many widget areas down to one widget area, you still "lose" widgets (in that they're set inactive, which, if you're working in the Customizer, doesn't exist). This ticket probably needs a better description.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If we don't use the concept of a widget group (&lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/19912" title="#19912: feature request: Add Widget Groups and Locations (closed: maybelater)"&gt;#19912&lt;/a&gt;), what's an alternative to what core currently does in trying to guess a sidebar to re-assign the widgets to? Add a user step to ask where they'd like widgets (and nav menus) to appear as an interstitial when doing a theme switch? That doesn't seem ideal either.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Some ideas:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Throw all the widgets into whatever widget area there is without asking (and additionally make some design enhancements to make switching widget area easier)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Look for similar widget area IDs/names to map to
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It would also help to introduce the inactive widgets area into the Customizer.
&lt;/p&gt;

A great improvement here would be automating the generation of the mocked data, ideally as a grunt task.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
So to clarify, the main problem right now is that if you want to query for all sites' names, you would need to do an SQL join to ALL site option tables (or loop through them all). Yeah, that makes it pretty well impossible doesn't it (especially once you have a network with over 100 sites or so).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So this site_meta table would only be used for options you know you want to query, right?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Admittedly, it would be a little confusing having two places for this site-specific data (is it in the options table or in the site meta table? Depends on how much we want to do a multi-site query involving it). This could probably be alleviated by having &lt;code&gt;get_site_option&lt;/code&gt; magically check in the blog meta table for entries it knows are stored there and not in the options table. Eh?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So if a similar menu names exists on the new theme, then the memu connection would remain?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Would there be an option for mapping the existing menus names, to the new menu names in the new theme easily?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think there's a couple things we could do:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If your old theme only has one menu and your new theme only has one menu, just map them automatically
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If your old theme and new theme share a similar IDs or names, map them automatically
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If your old theme has more than one menu, or your new theme has more than one menu, map the menu in the first menu location in your old theme to the first menu location in the new theme.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;
FWIW I hate menu locations :)

&lt;p&gt;
So - for those who need to run it side by side (I know I am late to the party, but we manage 200+ WP sites and I still have a critical one running on WP 4.7 and WP-API 1.2), is it expected that we change the prefix on the plugin or in WordPress core??  Is there a customizable option/constant in wp-config where I can set this URL prefix instead of hacking core?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I ended up using that filter &lt;code&gt;rest_url_prefix&lt;/code&gt; and it works fine.  &lt;code&gt;wp-rest&lt;/code&gt; is not considered a reserved word, but I think I can manage.
&lt;/p&gt;

This was previously fixed in &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/17979" title="#17979: task (blessed): Avoid losing widgets when switching themes (closed: fixed)"&gt;#17979&lt;/a&gt; for 3.3, sounds like there was a regression somewhere.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
So - for those who need to run it side by side (I know I am late to the party, but we manage 200+ WP sites and I still have a critical one running on WP 4.7 and WP-API 1.2), is it expected that we change the prefix on the plugin or in WordPress core??  Is there a customizable option/constant in wp-config where I can set this URL prefix instead of hacking core?
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;i&gt;Description&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Milestone&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If we don't use the concept of a widget group (&lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/19912" title="#19912: feature request: Add Widget Groups and Locations (closed: maybelater)"&gt;#19912&lt;/a&gt;), what's an alternative to what core currently does in trying to guess a sidebar to re-assign the widgets to? Add a user step to ask where they'd like widgets (and nav menus) to appear as an interstitial when doing a theme switch? That doesn't seem ideal either.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So if a similar menu names exists on the new theme, then the memu connection would remain?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Would there be an option for mapping the existing menus names, to the new menu names in the new theme easily?
&lt;/p&gt;

I think &lt;code&gt;wordpress-importer&lt;/code&gt; cannot import media files.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It can and will do that as long as the old site is still accessible.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Other forms of complete site cloning is plugin territory, and there are a lot of them who offers both backup and cloning.

        <dc:creator>enrico.sorcinelli</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Wed, 25 Jan 2017 18:39:54 GMT</pubDate>

      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39691/1485369594819873</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
This patch offers a small improvement to wpLink (and tinymce plugin) autocomplete search in order to reduce requests to the server.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It normalizes the search terms by make it lowercase (based on DB collate setting) and trims / removes redundant blank spaces before to send a new one search.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I know, this way (for example by putting two words separate by several blank spaces), it can skip the first &lt;code&gt;CASE&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;WHEN&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;ORDER BY&lt;/code&gt; clause, since the exact query is used into a &lt;code&gt;LIKE&lt;/code&gt; statement to determine the order value.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The patch also exposes &lt;code&gt;dbcollate&lt;/code&gt; JavaScript variabile in the admin header that is used to check case insensitive DB setting. I think that it could be useful also in other situations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Feedback and suggestions are appreciated
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Regards
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
PS: I haven't seen any tests (phpunit/qunit) related to wpLink so currently I haven't provided a new one.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Since WP 4.7, there is a workaround. Use the filter &lt;code&gt;get_terms_args&lt;/code&gt; and test &lt;code&gt;$args['object_ids']&lt;/code&gt; to know if &lt;code&gt;get_terms()&lt;/code&gt; has been called directly or through &lt;code&gt;wp_get_object_terms()&lt;/code&gt;. Of course, this is a workaround and a dedicated filter as proposed here would offer a more robust solution.
&lt;/p&gt;

Thanks for your explanation. I understood. There is a visual focus problem if there are many plugins is installed but not activated.

WordPress allows you to &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-importer/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;import&lt;/a&gt;/export data (content including meta data and media) via XML, if that's what you're looking for.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Can you please add the feature of clone contents of one site to another? If someone has a wordpress blog, say A, and another has another blog, say B. It could be useful to clone contents of page &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; in A to B. So copy the contents of blog, metadata and copy the media files in media theque.
&lt;/p&gt;

Seems like you guys should work together / coordinate on who's updating a patch :-)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/39650/39650.4.patch" title="Attachment '39650.4.patch' in Ticket #39650"&gt;39650.4.patch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/39650/39650.4.patch" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt; is not needed. That would be to big of a change. Adding the message argument to the &lt;code&gt;WP_Error&lt;/code&gt; object automatically displays that message when posting the comment. That's why the &lt;code&gt;exit;&lt;/code&gt; there is just fine as-is.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/39650/39650.5.patch" title="Attachment '39650.5.patch' in Ticket #39650"&gt;39650.5.patch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/39650/39650.5.patch" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt; does not need to touch &lt;code&gt;wp-comments-post.php&lt;/code&gt; either. Also, why adding the error message to every &lt;code&gt;WP_Error&lt;/code&gt; object and not just on &lt;code&gt;comment_on_draft&lt;/code&gt; (the original scenario described in the ticket)?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The error message should probably only be shown if the user has the capability to read the post, so a &lt;code&gt;current_user_can()&lt;/code&gt; check seems to be needed.
&lt;/p&gt;

You can see the value of $req_url from the html source

Hi,
Ever since my PHP updated to 7, my users no longer receive emails when they have a response to their comments. I have tried the Reply Me plug in, Subscribe to Comments Reloaded, Replyable, and Comment Reply Notification. None work. Please advise what I should do.

IIRC we didn't add the primary class there on purpose because it's not the primary action on that screen. We added it for plugins that are being installed through Shiny Updates (Install -&amp;gt; Installing... -&amp;gt; Installed -&amp;gt; Activate, where Activate will be primary).
&lt;/p&gt;

@truongwp Thanks for opening the ticket and adding a patch.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If several plugins are activated, there might be several buttons with the &lt;code&gt;button-primary&lt;/code&gt; class applied at once. Do you think this might be an issue for screen readers or visual focus?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The primary class is usually added to indicate "this is the primary action on this screen" - I'm not sure that applies to 'Activate'.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
While having a closer look at Requests (and also the way it is used in WP), I noticed something that appears to be a bug.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;code&gt;$headers&lt;/code&gt; variable that is passed from &lt;code&gt;WP_Http::request()&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;Requests::request()&lt;/code&gt; is an array of &lt;code&gt;$key =&amp;gt; $value&lt;/code&gt; pairs where &lt;code&gt;$value&lt;/code&gt; may be an array itself in case multiple values for that header have been passed to &lt;code&gt;WP_Http::request()&lt;/code&gt;. However, the Requests library expects each &lt;code&gt;$value&lt;/code&gt; of the &lt;code&gt;$headers&lt;/code&gt; array to always be a string, as it uses &lt;code&gt;sprintf()&lt;/code&gt; with it directly (the passed &lt;code&gt;$headers&lt;/code&gt; array is sent through &lt;code&gt;Requests::flatten()&lt;/code&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This can cause issues when specifying multiple headers of the same name.
&lt;/p&gt;

@milindmore22 Please note that your patch would break commenting on private posts.

      <description>&lt;i&gt;Keywords&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Version&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Summary&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
What @dhanendran said. Also, the code would need somebrackets to follow the &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/php/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;WordPress PHP coding standards&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
However, I don't think hiding the comment form for draft posts is the ideal solution here. Allowing comments on drafts might be desirable under some circumstances (live previews in the customizer, REST API, etc. See also &lt;a class="new ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/19739" title="#19739: enhancement: Filters to allow comments on draft &amp;amp; trash post_status posts (new)"&gt;#19739&lt;/a&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Instead of a blank page there should be an actual &lt;em&gt;error message&lt;/em&gt;. This means changing &lt;code&gt;wp_handle_comment_submission()&lt;/code&gt; accordingly, where there's currently this line: &lt;code&gt;return new WP_Error( 'comment_on_draft' );&lt;/code&gt; (note the lack of error message).
&lt;/p&gt;

@sagarprajapati It's better to have this condition after the first &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/blob/master/wp-includes/comment-template.php#L2170"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;`if` condition&lt;/a&gt;. Because there might be some chances the &lt;code&gt;$post_id&lt;/code&gt; will be &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;if ( null === $post_id )
    $post_id = get_the_ID();

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
The latest version of MediaElement (3.0.2 by the end of the week) has covered many new media types. But there are things that need to be updated on your side to make it work:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Remove prior files and include new files inside &lt;strong&gt;wp-includes/js/mediaelement&lt;/strong&gt; folder
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On &lt;strong&gt;wp-includes/js/mediaelement/wp-mediaelement.js&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ol class="loweralpha"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Remove lines related to Silverlight (since it’s no longer supported)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Change line &lt;em&gt;if ('flash' === mejs.pluginType&lt;/em&gt;) to &lt;em&gt;if (mejs.rendererName.match(/flash/gi) !== null)&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add in the player settings &lt;strong&gt;classPrefix: 'mejs-&lt;/strong&gt;'  to support prior class styles, since now uses BEM naming convention.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Replace &lt;strong&gt;wp-includes/js/mediaelement/wp-mediaelement.min.js&lt;/strong&gt; with changes specified above.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Modify &lt;strong&gt;wp-includes/script-loader.php&lt;/strong&gt; to update the reference to MediaElementJS changing lines:
&lt;ol class="loweralpha"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;$scripts-&amp;gt;add( 'mediaelement', "/wp-includes/js/mediaelement/mediaelement-and-player.min.js", array('jquery'), '3.0.0', 1 );&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;$styles-&amp;gt;add( 'mediaelement', "/wp-includes/js/mediaelement/mediaelementplayer-legacy.min.css", array(), '3.0.0');&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Translations provided in &lt;em&gt;mejsL10n&lt;/em&gt;; refer to &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/johndyer/mediaelement/blob/master/src/js/languages/en.js"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://github.com/johndyer/mediaelement/blob/master/src/js/languages/en.js&lt;/a&gt; to see new format and whole list of translations
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s worth to expand your Embeds code to use MediaElementJS to support new formats such as HLS, M(PEG)-DASH, YouTube, Vimeo, SoundCloud, Facebook and DailyMotion.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
The password reset form definitely needs an overhaul. We also have several users be completely unable to use the form, eventually requiring manual intervention.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The pre-filled password is assumed to be already set, so people just copy it and try to log in with it directly. This could be alleviated by renaming the "Reset Password" button to simply "Set Password", and making the page block navigating away from it without hitting the button.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The pre-filled password box doesn't look or feel like an editable textbox, so users don't know how to change what is in it. Thus the hint of "Enter your new password below" is useless, as there seemingly is nowhere to enter it.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Users click the "Reset Password" button without noting the suggested password, because they didn't have any active role in filling in that box. I suggest leaving the box empty with a "Generate Password" button next to it that fills it on demand. Also, put input focus in the box on page load.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

@afercia So maybe &lt;code&gt;#RGB…&lt;/code&gt; would be a good placeholder?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hm not sure :) That could be a bit misleading, it made me immediately think to the rgb format.

Thanks @dlh ! @westonruter at this point maybe the &lt;code&gt;keyup&lt;/code&gt; event can be removed from &lt;code&gt;api.Menus.AvailableMenuItemsPanelView.events&lt;/code&gt; too?
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #39685 (Twenty Seventeen: Pagination links don't appear for home pages) created</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Steps to reproduce:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create a new page and split its content with &amp;lt;!--nextpage--&amp;gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Set this page to be your Home one (under Settings/Reading)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visit the page in the front-end
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The Pagination links aren't shown at all in the bottom of the page.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This works if the page isn't set for Home and also works with the "TwentySixteen" theme.
&lt;/p&gt;

Should use &lt;code&gt;button-primary&lt;/code&gt; class for Activate button in Add plugins page (like after installing plugin)
&lt;/p&gt;

Since the last comments here, the Customizer has dropped support for IE 8. As I understand &lt;a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/26600#comment:59"&gt;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/26600#comment:59&lt;/a&gt; and other similar discussions (e.g. &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38021" title="#38021: enhancement: Customize: remove support for IE8 (closed: fixed)"&gt;#38021&lt;/a&gt;), IE 8 support was the only reason to continue using &lt;code&gt;keyup&lt;/code&gt;, so &lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/32882/32882.diff" title="Attachment '32882.diff' in Ticket #32882"&gt;32882.diff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/32882/32882.diff" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt; removes it.

Calling &lt;code&gt;Walker_Page::walk()&lt;/code&gt; directly was causing an &lt;code&gt;Undefined index: item_spacing&lt;/code&gt; notice to be thrown, this adds an &lt;code&gt;isset()&lt;/code&gt; check to prevent it.&lt;br /&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Cool, if it's going to be on the label I think the single span solution can work nicely. I'm uploading a new patch - this one applies a single span to just the label (first) half of the title. The &lt;code&gt;vcard&lt;/code&gt; title on author archives title remains in place.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It also modifies &lt;code&gt;the_archive_title();&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;get_the_archive_title();&lt;/code&gt; to accept an argument defining the class name  - if left blank, you get a span without any class assigned.
&lt;/p&gt;
