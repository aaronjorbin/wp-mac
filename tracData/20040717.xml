As rpc.pingomatic.com seems to be down (or unreachable) more often in the last few days it becomes really annoying to use that feature ... a shorter timeout would really be appreciated. Thanks!
&lt;/p&gt;

Meanwhile ... template-functions-general.php moved from version 1.35 to version 1.38 ... and no fix for that bug ... the wordpress-sphere still starts its week on sunday. Imagine! Starting on sunday would make sunday the ultimate evil (day) of the week ... monday is supposed to have this meaning (at least in Europe) ... so let us have that day as first day of the worker-slave's week ... please!!! :-)
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
If you have the reading options in the administration panel set to show the most recent x number of days, say, 2 days, then as long as you post every day, this will be maintained.  However, if you don't post for 3 days, what will be displayed, still are the posts from the most recent 2 days when posting was done.  This is the desired effect.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you then post on the 4th day since you last posted, the front page will not display the most recent 2 days worth of posts -- it will only display posts from the fourth day.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The desired effect is for it to show the posts from the 4th day, and then the posts from the last day before that when there were posts made.  That way, you always maintain the most recent 2 days worth of posts on the front page, regardless of whether there was a gap in between them.
&lt;/p&gt;

if using mod_rewrite (and therefore getting URLs such as "mydomain.com/archives/some_category/"). The src urls to the link rating image get broken.
Need to be absolute rather than relative.
&lt;/p&gt;
