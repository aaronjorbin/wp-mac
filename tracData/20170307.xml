      <description>&lt;p&gt;
@afercia I've made very substantial arguments in the posts above about how not offering a custom tailored alternative code editor for screen readers is simply not fair to the people who use screen readers - as well as crippling the main WordPress code editor for those who don't use a screen reader. The notion that it's some kind of violation of screen readers' rights to give them a superior editing experience is absurd.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The notion that a code editor for non-screen readers would work well for screen readers is belied by the state of code editing software. There is no good combo software. It's not an accident. If we want to provide a better code editor experience, two code editors are required (1).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Your proposed approach is forcing us to the lowest common denominator. Hurray, another plain text editor for WordPress! Hurray the plain text editor for WordPress turned on by default! Not only that but current state of the art in WordPress is that neither the visual editor nor the plain text editor are reliable due to &lt;code&gt;wpautop&lt;/code&gt;. The worst of all possible worlds. Let's clean up WordPress's act in terms of:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;handling text (as a start, wpautop should disappear so that switching between visual and text does not break formatting)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;providing powerful tools to our users.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;
My company has spent a lot of treasure and time creating and maintaining an open source alternative WordPress editor which does not break pages when one switches between visual and code (&lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/foliopress-wysiwyg/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;Foliopress WYSIWYG&lt;/a&gt;). With the new WordPress editor and code editor, I'd like to:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;provide all WordPress users with a great editing experience.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;no longer have to maintain an extra complex tool ourselves.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Moreover, I totally disagree about turning off the new code editor by default and pushing people back to plain text. Why build great tools and then feed people plain porridge by default?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
@joedolson You make a very good point:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I want to make sure it's clear that there is no such thing as a screen reader user agent - a screen reader sits between the operating system and the user agent, and the user agent string received from the client is indistinguishable from any other user agent. Detecting a screen reader is not something that's currently possible
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thanks for the reminder. Afercia suggested:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As a second, not ideal, option: [new code editor] on by default with an easy to discover "switch" to the plain textarea.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Could we not make the reading path for the screen reader go right past a sign post which says:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;For a better screen reader code editing experience, press C now.&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This announcement doesn't even need to be more visible than a &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; sign to non-screen reader users.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Pressing C every time they use a code editor would be tedious for screen reader users who use a code editor frequently. While screen reader users could anticipate the announcement when opening up the code editor with a pre-emptive press so it wouldn't necessarily be all that bad, there should still be an editor preference for a low-fi, &lt;strong&gt;screen reader enhanced&lt;/strong&gt; editor within a user's profile.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let's strive to make screen reader users' lives better with a code editor which gives them controls and shortcuts which will make their work easier.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In terms of maintaining a level playing field, it would be a fair condition to add to the new code editor development to make that CodeMirror or other syntax highlighting editor can not be introduced &lt;strong&gt;until&lt;/strong&gt; the new screen reader code editor has been built and introduced. By the same token, the targets for this brand new code editor should remain achievable. The goal is not to stall the introduction of an improved code editor for non-screen reader users but to accelerate the release of a better code editor for screen reader users.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Faking a single editor by hiding visual functionality from screen reader users and hiding screen reader functionality from sighted users would still be two code editors but just raise the coding and maintenance burden five or ten-fold. It would also mean that we would always be incompatible with upgrades to CodeMirror or ACE or whichever code editor we choose. Improving the interaction between the two edit modes (screen reader mode, visual) would be an ongoing opportunity. Over time and with more interaction, someone is likely to have some brilliant ideas. To get to that point though, both code editors have to be completed and released.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
ok :) So, a few things to respond to.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Editors that do some of the things I mentioned wel:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The autocomplete in Visual Studio Code, I think, is the best implementation you're going to see in any web platform. Full disclosure: I had a hand in that one ;) I also really like the autocomplete in Visual Studio itself, its one of the more useful ones out there imho.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As for syntax error reporting, you misunderstood me there.  I don't want a hotkey to tell me about syntax errors, thats akin to compiling and praying for the best, which arguably is the way all other editors make me do it so far. So I don't really have a lot of examples on how to do this for you. What I am looking for is a mechanism that tells me about a syntax error as it happens, just like the visual indicator would show you the syntax error when it is found. The way I imagine this is hearing something like "&amp;lt;img sc="blah.jpg"&amp;gt; , has error" . I am thinking a hotkey to query what error was found would be useful, though. The only editors I know of that do this to some degree are Emacs with the emacspeak addon and Sodbeans, but Sodbeans is buggy in all sorts of other ways.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
As for joining the a11y team, I would but I'm absolutely swamped right now :) Perhaps in a few weeks when the laser robots stop hounding me :)
&lt;/p&gt;

It is regrettably tied up with pingback. Part of my ticket work is to try and separate the two.

We could also automatically disable CodeMirror for anyone coming in with a screen reader useragent (as it's no use to them).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You've mentioned the idea of a 'screen reader user agent' a couple of times now, and I want to make sure it's clear that there is no such thing as a screen reader user agent - a screen reader sits between the operating system and the user agent, and the user agent string received from the client is indistinguishable from any other user agent. Detecting a screen reader is not something that's currently possible, regardless of any other ethical considerations.

We could also automatically disable CodeMirror for anyone coming in with a screen reader useragent (as it's no use to them).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I wouldn't recommend that. First of all, for privacy and ethical reasons, I wouldn't support screen readers detection. Recently, there was some discussion about this issue on Slack and some important references are mentioned on this same ticket, see &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12423#comment:41" title="Comment 41"&gt;comment:41&lt;/a&gt; so I'll keep it short and won't repeat the same argumentations. Apart from that, from a technical perspective I'm not sure there are ways to detect screen readers, so this discussion seems to be purely academic.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Also, thinking that screen readers are used only by blind people it's a common assumption, and it's wrong. There are a lot of people with low vision who use screen readers as an aid and for them CodeMirror could be of same use.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Lastly, I'd like to remind that the accessibility team recommendation, as @rianrietveld summarised in &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12423#comment:63" title="Comment 63"&gt;comment:63&lt;/a&gt;, is to make the new code editor preferably off by default. As a second, not ideal, option: on by default with an easy to discover "switch" to the plain textarea.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
@zersiax thanks very much for your feedback. What about joining the a11y team and help us coding some a11y improvements? :)
&lt;/p&gt;

Hi,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I've added unit tests. I've also noticed that the &lt;code&gt;slugs&lt;/code&gt; parameter was previously &lt;code&gt;slug&lt;/code&gt;. For backwards compatibility my patch contains both, &lt;code&gt;slug&lt;/code&gt; for a single parameter, &lt;code&gt;slugs&lt;/code&gt; for an array. Happy to update if this is not expected.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
What if I'm on a holiday in a different timezone when I wrote the post? Might it make sense for the &lt;code&gt;date&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;date_gmt&lt;/code&gt; to not differ by gmt_offset? (Eg I'm usually in New York, UTC-5, but I went on a trip to Los Angeles,  UTC-8, and wrote a post at 12pm while there, so it's &lt;code&gt;date&lt;/code&gt; is 12:00, and its &lt;code&gt;date_gmt&lt;/code&gt; is 20:00). If that's a valid case, then when someone provides both the &lt;code&gt;date&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;date_gmt&lt;/code&gt;, we should probably just use those two values exactly, and not apply &lt;code&gt;gmt_offset&lt;/code&gt; to either.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Or maybe the dates should just always be in the site's timezone, regardless of the author's local time? If so, disregard this comment.
&lt;/p&gt;

Thanks for your wishlist @zersiax!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We can agree that the editor exposed to screen reader users - if we are going to beyond plain text - should have the following features to be an improvement over plain text:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Autocompletion
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quick navigation through the code (guessing this should be a next and previous &amp;lt;n-tag&amp;gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Syntax errors available (a keystroke to hear about them)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
There wouldn't be controls in/around the editor out of the box as this is a custom editor but if such controls exist in the final CodeMirror implementation of course they should turn up in the screen reader editor. Thank you for the reminder.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The next step now would be to find existing good implementations of those three features, either online or in an offline editor.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You wrote:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I haven't found any code editor, off or online, that does all of this, and I'm genuinely not sure if the web is the platform to build the first such editor on.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Would it be possible for you to give us a list of the code editors which do at least one of those features (and which ones) well so we could see the existing best prior art? Or if you cannot, perhaps you know some other experts who could give us such examples.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thank you very much for providing much needed front line expertise on the screen reader code editing experience.
&lt;/p&gt;

Some errors are added before &lt;code&gt;lostpassword_post&lt;/code&gt; and one is added after. It'd be nice if all of the errors were present when the action is called. This patch fixes that.

The MIME list has been extended to include more results:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
-- MacOS file types, namely those Apple didn't register with IANA)
-- parent classes (like &lt;code&gt;application/ogg&lt;/code&gt;, which some systems return instead of specific types like &lt;code&gt;video/ogg&lt;/code&gt;)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There's now a third function:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;/**
 * Retrieve the "real" file type from the file.
 *
 * This extends `wp_check_filetype()` to additionally
 * consider content-based indicators of a file's
 * true type.
 *
 * The content-based type will override the name-based
 * type if available and included in the $mimes list.
 *
 * @since xxx
 *
 * @see wp_check_filetype()
 * @see wp_check_filetype_and_ext()
 *
 * @param string $file Full path to the file.
 * @param string $filename The name of the file (may differ from $file due to $file being in a tmp directory).
 * @param array $mimes Optional. Key is the file extension with value as the mime type.
 * @return array Values with extension first and mime type.
 */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;wp_check_real_filetype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$filename&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$mimes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The idea is to abstract the type-checking from other sanitizing/handling being performed in &lt;code&gt;wp_check_filetype_and_ext()&lt;/code&gt; so that it can be called from other functions that might need a more robust type determination. &lt;code&gt;wp_check_filetype_and_ext()&lt;/code&gt; could then be reduced so that it calls this function, then handles its specific validation checks.
&lt;/p&gt;

Super simple, same I'm using for all my others as well could it be an issue that they're plural, maybe some sort of conflict with an update made in WP 4.7+?

Just looked in the schema.php and use_trackback was defined as 0, so if it was set there it would be set as 1.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Does anyone know where in core, trackback is defined as on by?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;q=trackback"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;q=trackback&lt;/a&gt;

These are the two errors I'm seeing, and again this only happened after WP 4.7+
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Are you able to post the arguments you're passing to &lt;code&gt;register_taxonomy()&lt;/code&gt; to aid with reproduction?

Replying to &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39550#comment:143" title="Comment 143"&gt;kosso&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yes. The .ogg extension for audio is also correct in that list in &lt;code&gt;functions.php&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Once thing I will point out though is that the 4.7.3 has fixed .m4a files for me and correctly identifies them as &lt;code&gt;audio/mp4&lt;/code&gt;   But the description in &lt;code&gt;functions.php&lt;/code&gt; has m4a as &lt;code&gt;audio/mpeg&lt;/code&gt; which is incorrect.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Just want to jump in and clarify how upload validation works as of 4.7.3, because it has changed a bit over the past few releases.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The current behavior is very much like the pre-4.7.1 behaviors in that 99% of it is based on the file name. The type that gets saved will probably be whatever is associated with the file extension in &lt;code&gt;get_allowed_mime_types()&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The main difference that remains is that when possible, a file's "true" MIME is checked using &lt;code&gt;fileinfo&lt;/code&gt;. If that "true" MIME begins with "application/", then the upload will only be allowed to continue if the "true" MIME also appears somewhere in &lt;code&gt;get_allowed_mime_types()&lt;/code&gt; list (irrespective of extension).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;m4a&lt;/code&gt; is in &lt;code&gt;get_allowed_mime_types()&lt;/code&gt; (albeit as &lt;code&gt;audio/mpeg&lt;/code&gt;), so unless &lt;code&gt;fileinfo&lt;/code&gt; returns something like "application/mp4", it will be allowed on through even if PHP and WordPress disagree on its type.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The OGV troubles reported a little higher up happened because the incorrect "true" type being reported began "application/", and thus WP was requiring that "application/ogg" appear somewhere in the whitelist.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
You called? ;)
Ok ...so I had a quick read through this thread and I am seeing things I both agree and disagree with.
Basically the talk I gave was about a number of code editors both on and offline, I covered Atom, Vs Code, CodeMirror and a couple of others. The only editor I am very slightly surprised by in a good way is Orion: &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://orionhub.org/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://orionhub.org/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That's slightly overkill for WordPress though. Most of the things I could say about that have already been stated, namely:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;ContentEditable is currently the only dynamic way I'm aware of to even make anything resembling a dynamic editor that's accessible to some degree, however as people have pointed out it's buggy and browser support varies quite a bit depending on what platform you're coming from.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
A multiline edit field, the other side of the spectrum,  is fine for screenreaders but does not give sighted users any form of syntax highlighting or autocompletion. When I see people implement Codemirror I tend to suggest to add a multiline edit field that either submits the code to the endpoint it needs to go to itself, or copies the written code to the codemirror instance on blur. This multiline edit field would only need to be visible for screenreaders, there's a myriad of ways to accomplish that.
Now I'm not saying that is an ideal solution, its a patch at best, but it helps those websites by giving them something to work towards.  What you guys are doing is radically different in the fact you either want to make an editor from scratch or modify an existing one. My wishlist for an editor with accessibility functions really doesn't deviate all that strongly from any of yours, I reckon, namely:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Autocompletion that actually works/reads
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quick way of navigating through the code, be it by tag, by function, etc
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If there are visual live announcements of errors or mistakes on a line, I would like to know about them
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Syntax highlighting is obviously something screenreaders can't really do anything with and there is no standard way of fixing that, so that one is not on my list.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If there are controls in/around the editor, I want these controls to either be keyboard accessible or have a keystroke attached to them that is discernible in an easy way.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Now this list is a sketch of an ideal situation. I haven't found any code editor, off or online, that does all of this, and I'm genuinely not sure if the web is the platform to build the first such editor on. But if you wanted a wishlist , here it is :)
&lt;/p&gt;

Thanks for the feedback, @kosso, @jbalyo. This is helpful for &lt;a class="reopened ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39963" title="#39963: enhancement: MIME Alias Handling (reopened)"&gt;#39963&lt;/a&gt;, which should fix most instances like these.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the meantime, unfortunately, any server throwing "application/*" as the "true" MIME type for a given file will be under heavy scrutiny, and if that "true" type isn't also whitelisted, it will fail. For people with the OGG issue, I think the code I shared earlier should fix it.
&lt;/p&gt;

I ran that file through an online MIME checker and it reports back video/ogg, so I'm not sure which is correct.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;application/ogg&lt;/code&gt; is not totally 'incorrect'. But &lt;code&gt;audio/ogg&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;video/ogg&lt;/code&gt; were ratified in 2008.
&lt;/p&gt;

Use dirname(), with unit tests.

I am also getting MIME: application/ogg  for .ogv and .oga files.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And also for your small.ogv test file.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Tested on: macOS + MAMP and Debian wheezy + Apache.

Hello blobfolio - no problem running the test here, I received this output:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;MIME: application/ogg
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Out of curiosity, do you get the same output if you use this file instead? &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://techslides.com/demos/sample-videos/small.ogv"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://techslides.com/demos/sample-videos/small.ogv&lt;/a&gt;

      <pubDate>Tue, 07 Mar 2017 20:34:02 GMT</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Of the 3 branches, only the last &lt;code&gt;$backup_sizes&lt;/code&gt; gives a relative path to the &lt;code&gt;wp_delete_file&lt;/code&gt; filter, as the other 2, &lt;code&gt;$meta['thumb']&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;$meta['sizes']&lt;/code&gt;, do a &lt;code&gt;str_replace()&lt;/code&gt; on the absolute path &lt;code&gt;$file&lt;/code&gt;, so the &lt;code&gt;path_join()&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;$uploadpath['basedir']&lt;/code&gt; is always a no-op (except when it messes up).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So the behavioural change would only be for the backup sizes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think it would make sense to make all 3 cases the same basic code, avoiding the non-semantic &lt;code&gt;str_replace()&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;basename()&lt;/code&gt; combo by using &lt;code&gt;dirname()&lt;/code&gt; instead, which would also fix the UTF-8 issue &lt;a class="reviewing ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/33227" title="#33227: defect (bug): &amp;#34;Delete Permantently&amp;#34; Only Deletes Original Size (UTF-8 file names) (reviewing)"&gt;#33227&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The following patch does this, with unit tests for backup sizes/&lt;code&gt;wp_delete_file&lt;/code&gt; filter and the &lt;a class="reviewing ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/33227" title="#33227: defect (bug): &amp;#34;Delete Permantently&amp;#34; Only Deletes Original Size (UTF-8 file names) (reviewing)"&gt;#33227&lt;/a&gt; UTF-8 case, and some cleaning up of other tests.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
(I looked at the reasonably recently updated plugins in those listed above
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
polylang, post-thumbnail-editor, geodirectory, upload-to-ftp, editor-by-mintboard, file-gallery, mapify-lite-google-maps-plus, xili-language, foogallery, conoha-object-sync
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
and only &lt;code&gt;mapify-lite-google-maps-plus&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;foogallery&lt;/code&gt;, which both use the no longer maintained &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/humanmade/WPThumb"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://github.com/humanmade/WPThumb&lt;/a&gt;, were expecting a relative path.)

No lies, that is actually the same OGV file I was using for testing purposes on my end - googled "sample OGV" and it came right up. Just to be sure, I re-downloaded from your URL, re-tested and did get the same output:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;MIME: application/ogg
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I ran that file through an online MIME checker and it reports back video/ogg, so I'm not sure which is correct.

Hello blobfolio - no problem running the test here, I received this output:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;MIME: application/ogg
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Out of curiosity, do you get the same output if you use this file instead? &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://techslides.com/demos/sample-videos/small.ogv"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://techslides.com/demos/sample-videos/small.ogv&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Same output whether or not the temporary "Disable Real MIME Check" plugin is activated.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The trouble (at least with the native upload) is &lt;code&gt;application/ogg&lt;/code&gt; isn't a valid MIME type for an OGV file. It is, however, valid for OGX files. WordPress is expecting &lt;code&gt;video/ogg&lt;/code&gt;, and since &lt;code&gt;application/ogg&lt;/code&gt; presumably isn't in your whitelist, it is being rejected. If the OGV example above is interpreted correctly, then it might just be that this one particular file is misnamed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you have a custom theme on your site, adding the following to its &lt;code&gt;functions.php&lt;/code&gt; should fix it:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;function ogx_upload_mimes( $existing_mimes = array() ) {
        $existing_mimes['ogx'] = 'application/ogg';
        $existing_mimes['ogv'] = 'video/ogg';
        return $existing_mimes;
}
add_filter( 'upload_mimes', 'ogx_upload_mimes' );
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;
FYI, I'm still experiencing this issue in WP 4.7.3 when attempting to upload OGV (OGG Video) files.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Are you comfortable enough with PHP to try and run a quickie test?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If so, take the code below and save it to the root of your WordPress installation (same folder as &lt;code&gt;wp-load.php&lt;/code&gt;), call it &lt;code&gt;test.php&lt;/code&gt; or something:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;require_once&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'wp-load.php'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;header&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Content-type: text/plain"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//This should point to an actual ogg file.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ogfile&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'test.ogv'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$finfo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;finfo_open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;FILEINFO_MIME_TYPE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$real_mime&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;finfo_file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$finfo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ogfile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nb"&gt;finfo_close&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$finfo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"MIME: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;$real_mime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Could not use fileinfo.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This tiny script is expecting an OGV file called &lt;code&gt;test.ogv&lt;/code&gt; in that same directory. I recommend using FTP to upload a copy of the OGV you were unable to upload through WordPress (renamed thusly).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Once the &lt;code&gt;test.php&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;test.ogv&lt;/code&gt; are in place, visit &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://yourdomain.com/test.php"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://yourdomain.com/test.php&lt;/a&gt; in a web browser. What does it output? On my server, I see: &lt;code&gt;MIME: video/ogg&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
(After you've gotten a response, feel free to delete the test files.)

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I'm thinking, as an alternative to my ticket, what about a WP_REST_Post_Query class that took an array of WP_Query ARGS and generated a proper response?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Opting out should remove all CodeMirror instances and cleanup itself (including the buttons), and also post an ajax request to user preferences to remember the choice. (The preference will be available on edit user.) This would be the least obtrusive way I think. We don't need a no-js plan, as with js disabled, CodeMirror is disabled.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Nice thinking @WraithKenny for a quick patch. This is a better user experience and fairly seamless for everyone out there. We could also automatically disable CodeMirror for anyone coming in with a screen reader useragent (as it's no use to them). We should still think about building that better code editor experience with helpers for screen reader users. I'm not a screen reader user so I don't know what additional functionality screen reader users would like.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hopefully @rianrietveld will come back to us from a wishlist (from Florian Beijers for instance). I'll ping him on Twitter now.
&lt;/p&gt;

FYI, I'm still experiencing this issue in WP 4.7.3 when attempting to upload OGV (OGG Video) files.

      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40064/1488911150532757</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
As discussed earlier and stated in &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/11/04/multisite-focused-changes-in-4-7/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/11/04/multisite-focused-changes-in-4-7/&lt;/a&gt;, let's deprecate the &lt;code&gt;get_blog_details()&lt;/code&gt; function. Its &lt;code&gt;blog_details&lt;/code&gt; filter has already been deprecated in 4.7, and this is the next step on the roadmap.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Maybe we can also remove the &lt;code&gt;blog_details&lt;/code&gt; filter occurrence in the &lt;code&gt;WP_Site&lt;/code&gt; class that was temporarily introduced in 4.7 (I'm not sure anymore that this was a clever idea, but we should be safe to remove it from that location since it was already introduced as being deprecated).
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
As discussed during today's multisite office-hours, there are a few issues in how the cache is currently invalidated when updating options.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;update_blog_option()&lt;/code&gt; should no longer call &lt;code&gt;refresh_blog_details()&lt;/code&gt;. This was already almost removed in &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/26410" title="#26410: defect (bug): Updating or deleting options via update_option or delete_option leaves ... (closed: fixed)"&gt;#26410&lt;/a&gt;, and there is no value in having this any longer, as options are generally not part of any site cache.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In &lt;code&gt;wp-includes/ms-default-filters.php&lt;/code&gt; the options &lt;code&gt;blogname&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;siteurl&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;post_count&lt;/code&gt; trigger a &lt;code&gt;refresh_blog_details()&lt;/code&gt; call which itself calls &lt;code&gt;clean_blog_cache()&lt;/code&gt;. That happens because these fields are part of a &lt;code&gt;WP_Site&lt;/code&gt; object through the special site details functionality. However, &lt;code&gt;clean_blog_cache()&lt;/code&gt; invalidates the entire site's cache including reset of &lt;code&gt;last_changed&lt;/code&gt; which is unnecessary here. Instead of hooking &lt;code&gt;refresh_blog_details()&lt;/code&gt; into these option updates, let's create a new function that only runs &lt;code&gt;wp_cache_delete( $blog_id , 'blog-details' )&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;wp_cache_delete( $blog_id, 'site-details' )&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For some reason the &lt;code&gt;home&lt;/code&gt; option is not part of the group of the above 3 options, although it's also part of site details. So let's hook the new function into an option update for &lt;code&gt;home&lt;/code&gt; as well.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

        <dc:creator>cookiesowns</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Tue, 07 Mar 2017 17:59:05 GMT</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Just an update to this comment for accuracy ( I wish I could update the original post )
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It seems I was a bit overzealous with my initial discovery / debugging... Was just quickly skimming through code that seems similar to the behavior I was seeing in our environment.. the LOC's I posted could potentially be related, but I don't think it's the core culprit.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After some additional reading, I believe &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/blob/master/wp-includes/meta.php#L247-L251"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/blob/master/wp-includes/meta.php#L247-L251&lt;/a&gt; to be the culprit of the issue.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Reasoning:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If for whatever reason wp_cache_delete fails on an update request and the cache was previously populated, the cache is now invalid and will return stale data.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Because the meta_update call requires the previous value to be accurate in order for the MySQL WHERE statement to work, the future update request will not go through thus never invalidating the cache anymore.
&lt;/p&gt;

There's some big projects on that list, including Adobe Brackets (and Dreamweaver), Bitbucket, Prose.io (github content editor), Codepen.io, JSFiddle, jsbin.com, Firefox Developer Tools, WebKit Web inspector.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
CodeMirror has dozens of themes, and it's just CSS so we can make some custom ones for Contrast and legibility if needed, or for branding.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It also has configurable keybindings with preconfigured options for Vim, Emacs, and Sublime Text bindings, if anyone from wpa11y has used those, and feels those keybindings are more accessible.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think from this thread that the consensus is that the new editor should be opt-out. To achieve that, a button should be inserted before the editors (with js because it's a js enhancement), that would opt a user out, if the user hasn't selected a preference yet (neither yes nor no).  Opting out should remove all CodeMirror instances and cleanup itself (including the buttons), and also post an ajax request to user preferences to remember the choice. (The preference will be available on edit user.) This would be the least obtrusive way I think. We don't need a no-js plan, as with js disabled, CodeMirror is disabled.
&lt;/p&gt;

As this is exactly what I doing a lot - editing text at a specific point by placing the cursor - and I don't have this problem.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I therefore suspect there are some third party script interacting with your editing. Have you tried this on a fresh install with no active plugins and a default theme? Have you tried with another browser or device?
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
It is common practice when editing some content within an application to simply put your cursor on where you want to insert some new or revised text and start typing.  When you attempt to do this in Wordpress, sometimes the cursor jumps to the end of the document and you lose the position of where you were editing.  To reproduce this problem:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Open a Wordpress post
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Position the cursor somewhere in the post
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Start typing to insert some text
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The cursor will jump to the end of the post, the text will go in there instead of where the cursor was positioned, and you will need to go back and find the original position where you intended to inserr the text
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

I think this would be a valuable enhancement because it would improve accessibility (for HTML5 and non-HTML5 user agents alike) by easily permitting the insertion of the role="navigation" attribute.

If you have the capability to publish a post (as Administrator, Editor or Author) there is no button to save as pending until you edit the Status. This action changes the &lt;code&gt;Save draft&lt;/code&gt; button to &lt;code&gt;Save as Pending&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Please try with no active plugins and a default theme. Reinstall WordPress from the updates screen.

I had the same problem, and figured out that due to server resource overload, hoster disabled cron automaticaly because it sensed a security issue. You should fix your webpage serving issue, and optimize it more efficiently, or transfer to more resourceful hosting package.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's possible that I might have a related problem.  I recently moved web hosting providers, and am having a problem that the cron for the wp-lifestream plugin isn't working.  However, I have now installed the WPX Cron Manager Light plugin, and there are many other plugins that aren't working.  I have attached some screen captures from WPX Cron Manager.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On page 1, wp_version_check is listed as 13 days late.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I have pushed the "Execute Now" for lifestream_cron, which updates the timer, but the actual cron has not created any updates.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a style="padding:0; border:none" href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/39340/20170212_1315_CronManager_p3.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/39340/20170212_1315_CronManager_p3.png" alt="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/39340/20170212_1315_CronManager_p3.png" crossorigin="anonymous" title="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/39340/20170212_1315_CronManager_p3.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I am running Wordpress 4.7.2.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In wp-config.php, I have tried setting ALTERNATE_WP_CRON as directed at &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Editing_wp-config.php#Alternative_Cron"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://codex.wordpress.org/Editing_wp-config.php#Alternative_Cron&lt;/a&gt; , but this doesn't not seem to help.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If someone would like to suggest additional diagnostic steps, they would be welcomed.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Anyone else experience that if you go on WP admin -&amp;gt; Settings -&amp;gt; General
and try to save Date Format or Time Format to Custom, it do not change/update nothing on saving but reset to the previous setting?
&lt;strong&gt;
Also, i try to use&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;date_i18n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'H:i Y-m-d'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;topic_last_post_time&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
passing a timestamp, that return ever the same, whatever i can change the timezone setting. Maybe on this i've not understand something, but about the above, i'm not the only one experiencing this behavior about Custom setting for Date Format or Time Format.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thank you!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Any idea?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
could we instead concatenate the date_format and time_format values with a space?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Nope. String concatenation is always bad for i18n. Also, these strings already exists like that, see &lt;code&gt;WP_Locale::_strings_for_pot()&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ah right. What I don't like about it though is that there would be no way for the user to modify the &lt;code&gt;datetime&lt;/code&gt; format. It might be worth considering an option for that. On the other hand this might look over-complicated to the user ("I already added date and time formats").
What about concatenating date and time format through another translation string &lt;code&gt;sprintf( _x( '%1$s %2$s', 'concatenation of date and time format' ), $date_format, $time_format )&lt;/code&gt;? Then it would be manageable per locale. A locale that does not support concatenation of these values in any way could return an empty string, and in that case it would fall back to what we currently have there. We could even go as far as providing an option for users of a locale that doesn't support concatenation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yes, I might be overthinking this, but I think we need a bit more flexibility here.
&lt;/p&gt;

Hi @BackuPs, thanks for the ticket!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Looking into general-template.php i can see that the previous and next do not take into account for excluded categories. There is also no filter to add excluded categories into the arguments passed to the query.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That's right, the calendar should be switched over to use &lt;code&gt;get_posts()&lt;/code&gt; instead of custom SQL queries.

      <description>&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
could we instead concatenate the date_format and time_format values with a space?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Nope. String concatenation is always bad for i18n. Also, these strings already exists like that, see &lt;code&gt;WP_Locale::_strings_for_pot()&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Looking at &lt;code&gt;wpDateSettings&lt;/code&gt;, it seems like a &lt;code&gt;WP_Locale&lt;/code&gt; JS counterpart would be helpful. To get all these formats etc. of the current locale. Perhaps we can handle that in &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/20491" title="#20491: enhancement: Introduce some JavaScript i18n functions (closed: fixed)"&gt;#20491&lt;/a&gt; or a new ticket afterwards.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Looking into general-template.php i can see that the previous and next do not take into account for excluded categories. There is also no filter to add excluded categories into the arguments passed to the query.
&lt;/p&gt;

Looks great!  Glad to see the decision to go with moment - it definitely removes much of the extra work that would have been done.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To echo @flixos90 and confirm the approach, I've done mapping of formats similarly in other projects as well.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Within the mapping, should the &lt;code&gt;date&lt;/code&gt; argument be clarified in jsdocs so that its clear it is expecting a moment date object?  maybe even rename the variable to &lt;code&gt;dateMoment&lt;/code&gt; so its extra clear?
&lt;/p&gt;

        <dc:creator>esemlabel</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Tue, 07 Mar 2017 13:11:56 GMT</pubDate>

      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40060/1488892316537808</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
If user is logged in and tries to open /wp-login.php page, he never couldn't do this if ADMIN_COOKIE_PATH is set to root '/' (is equal to COOKIEPATH). Instead, the redirect to /wp-admin/ will occur. Even more, many of function during page load will run twice.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In a long route of functions, the last one is wp_parse_auth_cookie(), which return false to many functions called from, which cause "true" check in wp-login.php on line 814, where unneeded redirect happens.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;is_wp_error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$reauth&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;wp_redirect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$redirect_to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;exit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In regular situation, wp_parse_auth_cookie() return "false" when checking auth cookie on wp-login.php from path '/', because existing one is for /wp-admin path. So wp-login.php loads normally.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;empty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$_COOKIE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$cookie_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But if ADMIN_COOKIE_PATH is defined with value, that not differs from COOKIEPATH or SITECOOKIEPATH - it return "true" and forever redirect to /wp-admin/.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Any ideas to solve this?
&lt;/p&gt;

There &lt;strong&gt;is no way to save without publishing&lt;/strong&gt; the post..
In fact there is no save as pending option at all, I downloaded 4.7.3 which is when this occurred I believe
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
The patch is looking great as far as I can tell (but let's wait for further reviews by more JSy people than me). I had implemented the mapping in a similar way in another project (the implementation here is more complete though), so I guess it shows we're following an approach that makes sense. I agree that using Moment.js is the right choice as we don't need to reinvent the wheel, and mapping the PHP formats is rather straightforward.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Something minor to consider: Instead of hard-coding &lt;code&gt;__( 'F j, Y g:i a' )&lt;/code&gt; for the datetime setting, could we instead concatenate the &lt;code&gt;date_format&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;time_format&lt;/code&gt; values with a space? Also, what is &lt;code&gt;formats.timezone&lt;/code&gt; used for (I couldn't see it anywhere in the code, why is that necessary)?
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Hi
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When you exclude a category site wide and suppose for this problem the month before this month has only ONE post and that post is excluded as it is part of the excluded category, then the calendar widget is still showing the next month as FEB and thus is still pointing to that month but when clicked upon it creates a 404 page. It should point to Jan and skip the month with that one post which is excluded.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
How to prevent this from happening? Is there a fix?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;exclude_blog_category_global&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$query&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;is_admin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;is_archive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                                &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$exclude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'-5'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
                                &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;empty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$exclude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                                        &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'cat'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$exclude&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
                                &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;add_action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'pre_get_posts'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'exclude_blog_category_global'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If i use query_posts in the archive php all is ok but when reading the codex it is suggested to use the pre_get_posts on main queries.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
How to fix this?  tested with Default sixteen template.
&lt;/p&gt;

Hi,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I am using a Bootstrap Theme and have a Tabs enabled on a page. These tabs has 'Next' 'Previous' buttons. Before the Update of 4.7.3 it was working fine with no issues but since I updated my blog to 4.7.3 the buttons are not working. I think there is some issue with update. Plz check.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thanks,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #40057 (Double hashed value for background-color of body.background-color) created</title>
      
        <dc:creator>hovhanneshovakimyan</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Tue, 07 Mar 2017 10:34:58 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40057</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40057/1488882898674487</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
The problem is that body.custom-background has background-color property which gets double hashed value.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So if theme is supporting custom background features, then you'll get wrong (double hashed) background-color value all the time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I have already found the cause of the problem.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Check this file:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
wp-includes/theme.php
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
on line: 1564
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
change this:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$style = $color ? "background-color: #$color;" : &lt;em&gt;;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
to this:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$style = $color ? "background-color: $color;" : &lt;em&gt;;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That will solve the problem.
&lt;/p&gt;

Hello!
Shift-click to select a range of check-boxes in admin area isn't working anymore since 4.7.3 update. It worked perfectly before this 4.7.3 update.
Thanks in advance!

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
My reading of &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://schema.org/ImageGallery"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://schema.org/ImageGallery&lt;/a&gt; is that it's used to mark up the &lt;em&gt;page&lt;/em&gt;, not the gallery. Note that it doesn't have any useful properties for marking up individual images, or captions, or anything that a service could use for parsing the gallery in a meaningful way, and is a subtype of WebPage. I don't think marking up the output of the gallery shortcode with this item type would be the correct usage of it.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Hi @swissspidy - for jQuery's datepicker, the S is invalid. This bug is only relating to formatting of dates using datepicker.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All available characters are shown here:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#utility-formatDate"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#utility-formatDate&lt;/a&gt;

Thanks @devonto!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It's worth noting that 'S' isn't really invalid. See &lt;a class="reviewing ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/22225" title="#22225: enhancement: WordPress does not localize ordinal suffixes in dates (reviewing)"&gt;#22225&lt;/a&gt; for some history.

The site's current timezone offset is an important piece of information for any REST API client that needs to manipulate dates.  It has not been previously available.&lt;br /&gt;

Expose both the &lt;code&gt;gmt_offset&lt;/code&gt; (the site's current offset from UTC in hours) and &lt;code&gt;timezone_string&lt;/code&gt; (which also provides information about daylight savings time) via the "site info" endpoint (the base &lt;code&gt;/wp-json&lt;/code&gt; response).&lt;br /&gt;

What if we simply drop back the whole solution to something that already works for &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt;?, by simply using gettext an already normal translations tools?.
We could add 31 strings to translate, with proper context to make sure that they're understood and correctly translated.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
_x( 'st', 'Ordinal suffix for day 1 in month, "-" for empty', 'my-text-domain'
_x( 'nd', 'Ordinal suffix for day 2 in month, "-" for empty', 'my-text-domain'
_x( 'rd', 'Ordinal suffix for day 3 in month, "-" for empty', 'my-text-domain'
_x( 'th', 'Ordinal suffix for day 4 in month, "-" for empty', 'my-text-domain'
_x( 'th', 'Ordinal suffix for day 5 in month, "-" for empty', 'my-text-domain'
_x( 'st', 'Ordinal suffix for day 31 in month, "-" for empty', 'my-text-domain'
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
...
And then wrap it up in a simple function?
&lt;/p&gt;

Replying to &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39746#comment:5" title="Comment 5"&gt;dd32&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thanks @jobst, this could be something similar to &lt;a class="new ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/35517" title="#35517: defect (bug): Work around PHP7 php-ssh2 breakage (new)"&gt;#35517&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don't think that this is anything to do with WordPress and is more likely that the libssh build you're using isn't compatible with either php or your ssh server.
This probably needs someone to duplicate it outside of WordPress and reported upstream to their bug tracker.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
IMHO it is both Wordpress and pecl networking ssh2, and it is fixable.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I basically followed the instructions as laid out in these two links and it works for me:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/35517/class-wp-filesystem-ssh2.php.patch"&gt;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/35517/class-wp-filesystem-ssh2.php.patch&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/php/pecl-networking-ssh2/commit/17680cf039f0cfac53b5a2531fdb715b95e9cc42"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://github.com/php/pecl-networking-ssh2/commit/17680cf039f0cfac53b5a2531fdb715b95e9cc42&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
My take on Wordpress and it's IMHO:
If you look at the pecl resource above it shows that after after php 7.0.28 and php 5.6.28 there is a need for "clean id" for function calls when using ssh2.sftp://, not an object as in "Resource &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/447" title="#447: defect (bug): Admin login flashes error message but logs in anyways (closed: fixed)"&gt;#447&lt;/a&gt;" but just "447".
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I have tried to implement this in "class-wp-filesystem-ssh2" like so:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt; public function sftp_path( $path ) {
    error_log(__FUNCTION__.": LINK &amp;gt;".$this-&amp;gt;sftp_link."&amp;lt; PATH &amp;gt;$path&amp;lt;");
	if ( '/' === $path ) {
		$path = '/./';
    }
    // not working
    $RetVal=print_r($this-&amp;gt;sftp_link,true);
    error_log("RetVal &amp;gt;$RetVal&amp;lt;");
    $pos=strpos($RetVal,"Resource id",0);
    error_log("POS &amp;gt;".$pos."&amp;lt;");
    if($pos!==false)
    {
      error_log("YEP, object found");
      $RetVal = str_replace("Resource id #","",$RetVal);
      $RetVal = "ssh2.sftp://" . $RetVal . "/" . ltrim( $path, "/");
      error_log("RetVal &amp;gt;$RetVal&amp;lt;");
      return $RetVal;
    }
    else
    {
      // else
      error_log("NO, not object");
      return 'ssh2.sftp://' . $this-&amp;gt;sftp_link . '/' . ltrim( $path, '/' );
    }
 }
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
but I could not get this to work :-(, it made no change.
So when I look at the code in "class-wp-filesystem-ssh2.php" there are already many functions used from the ssh2_sftp library (i.e. ssh2_sftp_realpath), so why not using one extra one called "ssh2_sftp_stat()" to return values for "exists(), is_file(), is_dir(), is-readable(), atime(), mtime()"? This way one can be sure that the values returned are correct! So I followed the instructions (35517) and changed my file and it works!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My take on Pecl Networking ssh2:
I added some extra lines to the the file ssh2_fopen_wrappers.c from the pecl tar.gz just to see whether I was interpreting the code correctly, and yes ALL IT DOES chopping the "Resouce id#" from the string before using it:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;    bcgFile=fopen("/var/log/openwrapper.log", "a");
    if(bcgFile==NULL) {
		perror("Error opening file.");
    }
    /* Starting with 5.6.28, 7.0.13 need to be clean, else php_url_parse will fail */
    char *tmp = estrdup(path);
    fprintf(bcgFile, "BEFORE %s BEFORE\n", tmp);
    strncpy(tmp + (h-path), h + sizeof("Resource id #")-1, strlen(tmp)-sizeof("Resource id #"));
    fprintf(bcgFile, " AFTER %s AFTER", tmp);
    resource = php_url_parse(tmp);
    efree(tmp);
    fclose(bcgFile);
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I can only say it works, I tried it on a number of installs, no problem.
&lt;/p&gt;

When you run the entire &lt;code&gt;phpunit&lt;/code&gt; test suite it also updates the &lt;code&gt;wp-api-generated.js&lt;/code&gt; fixture file if needed.  When we make changes to the default API responses, this file needs to be updated as well.  See &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39264" title="#39264: enhancement: Add WP-API JS Client unit tests to core (closed: fixed)"&gt;#39264&lt;/a&gt; for more info about that.

(If desired, we could actually have all the times on the page update live as well, such as the ones for the timezone selector. That requires a little extra work that I didn't feel was necessary, but if anyone thinks it's a good idea, go for it.)

WP_Query: Add missing tests for combinations of &lt;code&gt;orderby&lt;/code&gt; and include parameters.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This commit adds some missing test cases for combinations of &lt;code&gt;orderby&lt;/code&gt; and other parameters (&lt;code&gt;post_parent__in&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;post_name__in&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Followup to &lt;a class="changeset" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/40056" title="WP_Query: Add tests for the combination of `orderby=post__in` and ..."&gt;[40056]&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;code&gt;orderby&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;post__in&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The interaction of these parameters is perhaps counterintuitive because &lt;code&gt;orderby&lt;/code&gt; does not affect the returned results.  This is overall probably the best design, and it's now better tested and documented.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
The new tests look good, I uploaded &lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/39055/39055.2.diff" title="Attachment '39055.2.diff' in Ticket #39055"&gt;39055.2.diff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/39055/39055.2.diff" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt; to fix a few whitespace issues (trailing whitespace on one line, and spaces mixed with tabs inside the array indentations on a few other lines).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Compare the two patches on Trac and you can see some of this visually; the rest, I can do with &lt;code&gt;cat -A patch.diff&lt;/code&gt; but I think these flags vary a bit by OS.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;i&gt;Keywords&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/39222/39222.diff" title="Attachment '39222.diff' in Ticket #39222"&gt;39222.diff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/39222/39222.diff" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt; adds &lt;code&gt;wp-date.js&lt;/code&gt; (and &lt;code&gt;wp.date.*&lt;/code&gt;), which relies on moment.js (also included). It also removes the Ajax endpoints used for previewing formatted date/times, and replaces it with live JS instead:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a style="padding:0; border:none" href="http://i.imgur.com/Ht202ww.gif"&gt;&lt;img src="http://i.imgur.com/Ht202ww.gif" alt="http://i.imgur.com/Ht202ww.gif" crossorigin="anonymous" title="http://i.imgur.com/Ht202ww.gif" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This removes two admin-ajax.php endpoints (&lt;code&gt;date_format&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;time_format&lt;/code&gt;), and moves them to &lt;code&gt;wp-admin/includes/deprecated.php&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It introduces new functions you can use:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;wp.date.format()&lt;/code&gt; - Format a date.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;wp.date.date()&lt;/code&gt; - Format a date in the site's timezone.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;wp.date.gmdate()&lt;/code&gt; - Format a date in UTC.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;wp.date.date_i18n()&lt;/code&gt; - Format a date, and translate it.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
There are some pieces missing from the date translations:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ordinals aren't translated - this matches core, see &lt;a class="reviewing ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/22225" title="#22225: enhancement: WordPress does not localize ordinal suffixes in dates (reviewing)"&gt;#22225&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's no equivalent of &lt;code&gt;human_time_diff()&lt;/code&gt; - This requires full i18n support (for plurals), and hence needs &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/20491" title="#20491: enhancement: Introduce some JavaScript i18n functions (closed: fixed)"&gt;#20491&lt;/a&gt; first.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Otherwise, should be basically complete feature-wise. This should probably have unit tests.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This needs docs once we merge it; I'm not sure if our JSDocs are parsed out anywhere right now, so in lieu of that, regular pages somewhere would be great.
&lt;/p&gt;

I have a lovely little patch for this working. Ended up using moment, since it's very useful, and provides a good building block for other JS.

@All
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the user list there are two completely different counts of users. How to fix the problem?
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;i&gt;Keywords&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Version&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Milestone&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This will likely be even more visible when VVV 2.0 ships, as MariaDB 10.1 is default.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We changed the default core &lt;code&gt;varchar&lt;/code&gt; keys to &lt;code&gt;varchar(191)&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;a class="changeset" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/31349" title="WPDB: If a site is using the `utf8` charset, and their version of ..."&gt;[31349]&lt;/a&gt; so that utf8mb4 could be supported. I think it makes sense to change any keys created in the &lt;code&gt;dbDelta&lt;/code&gt; tests as well. It's probably not core's responsibility to check whether a DB can support any more than that.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/35958/35958-varchar-191-object-property.diff" title="Attachment '35958-varchar-191-object-property.diff' in Ticket #35958"&gt;35958-varchar-191-object-property.diff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/35958/35958-varchar-191-object-property.diff" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt; seems to make the most sense at first glance, though I wouldn't be opposed to &lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/35958/35958-varchar-191-string-literal.diff" title="Attachment '35958-varchar-191-string-literal.diff' in Ticket #35958"&gt;35958-varchar-191-string-literal.diff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/35958/35958-varchar-191-string-literal.diff" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt; either.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Hi,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There appears to be an issue with WP_Cache if/when an object-cache has a stale value, and you attempt to update that value to the value that already exists in the database ( race condition as an example ). The object-cache in this case will never be invalidated until the TTL is hit, or if/when the cache is flushed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This affects high volume sites that has repetitive actions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
An example of this happens on our site in production on user_meta, where quick endpoints fire that requires a set value on user_meta, however occasionally redis-cache will not get updated with the new value, even though the wp database does have the proper value.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In this case there's an infinite loop where wp_cache will return the old stale value, and the code will correctly attempt to update it to the new value, but WP thinks the value is already correct, and thus the object-cache will not be updated.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Potentially related bugs are &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/26779" title="#26779: defect (bug): Multiple mediaelement instances of the same self-hosted video file on ... (closed: fixed)"&gt;#26779&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a class="assigned ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31245" title="#31245: enhancement: Replace alloptions with a key cache (assigned)"&gt;#31245&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
An easy solution is to add a wp_cache_delete onto lines 195/196 here: &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/blob/master/wp-includes/meta.php#L190-L253"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/blob/master/wp-includes/meta.php#L190-L253&lt;/a&gt;

Hi Rian,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You wrote:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At the moment there is no code editor that works well with screen readers. 2 Weeks ago I listened to a talk by Florian Beijers (@zersiax on Twitter): Accessibility in software development tools. Florian is a blind software developer and he tested a lot of code editors and none performed sufficient for screen readers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Could you get a wish list from Florian Beijers perhaps and we could build him one. There's enough talent in core Trac that there's nothing stopping us from building a good prototype screen reader editor. I'll admit that if we have to make it work properly within an existing code editor (no reason we should), the task is about ten times more complicated. But if we just focus on the screen reader experience we should be able get to working prototype within weeks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I find it exciting that WordPress core might be able to make a substantial contribution to the screen reader editing experience and provide a prototype which other CMS could take and add to their own code edit module. We &lt;strong&gt;can&lt;/strong&gt; change the world for the better.
&lt;/p&gt;

I haven't started a trouble ticket before, so I'm not familiar with the fixing timeframe. How long does it tend to take before there is any activity? Is there anything I can do to move along the process?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don't really think this is a "Media" problem, for what it's worth.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Visitors to my site have been getting redirect loops for six weeks on pages such as &lt;code&gt;http://yourfriendpaul.com/wp/shredding-on-my-guitar.html/good-at-shredding-dscn4850-1200x900&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;http://yourfriendpaul.com/wp/the-illusion-of-control.html/placebo-like-icon&lt;/code&gt;.

@FolioVision about your question
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What is the best existing implementation of accessibility for screen readers in a code editor?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At the moment there is no code editor that works well with screen readers.
2 Weeks ago I listened to a talk by Florian Beijers (@zersiax on Twitter): Accessibility in software development tools. Florian is a blind software developer and he tested a lot of code editors and none performed sufficient for screen readers. So a plain text editor works best for screen reader users at the moment. Maybe in a few years this will improve, but not at the moment.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
The filter 'handle_bulk_actions-users' does not fire. Diving into Wordpress' core files (on both 4.7.2 and 4.7.3) reveals that &lt;code&gt;apply_filters()&lt;/code&gt; is not even being reached to fire the filter. (Looking at wp-admin/users.php around line 418).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I have disabled all plugins except the one that I am currently building to verify there is nothing causing a conflict.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Steps to reproduce:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add the filter 'handle_bulk_actions-users'
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Attempt to log "Hello World!" inside that filter's callback function
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;
-or-
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just follow the example on &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/10/04/custom-bulk-actions/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/10/04/custom-bulk-actions/&lt;/a&gt; -- using this filter name instead

Hi there.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don't know if this is a WordPress issue or my server has it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In "General Setting" the Universal Time is +1 hour than the normal.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
How can I fix this?
&lt;/p&gt;

@westonruter, I was searching for other appearances like that, and I found:

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Do you think we should fix them as part of this ticket, or create another ticket for that?

&lt;p&gt;
I don't know what compression methods are currently being used on upload. Last I knew it was a straight 90% JPEG compression.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I believe this ticket has more to do with how WP handles the "full" size than compression changes in the general sense, although there's always room for improvement there as well.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
WP does more for image compression than it used to -- especially if the user has Imagick available. It changed significantly in WP 4.5, and you can see some of the details here (and of course in &lt;code&gt;WP_Image_Editor_Imagick&lt;/code&gt;):

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Thanks for the notes Rian. It supports what I've written three or four times on this thread.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The needs of screen reader users (blind users for example) are &lt;strong&gt;completely different&lt;/strong&gt; than non-screen reader users (sighted users).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Could we please, please focus on the &lt;strong&gt;needs of both groups&lt;/strong&gt; instead of &lt;strong&gt;kneecapping both&lt;/strong&gt; of them. Yes, they are equal but they are not identical. Treating them identical insults the needs of both.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We should offer a great solution to both groups, not a half solution to each.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Coloured syntax. Rian you wrote:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It looks nice, if you are a coder and used to sublime text etc, but is there real value for the common user?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You bet. The unreliable existing visual editor (which breaks any complex formatting you put into it) and equally unreliable drab text editor included out of the box are disheartening. Who the heck wants to work with broken/inadequate tools?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Clear coloured presentation of source code makes it much easier to edit a complex post or even for a beginner to determine what HTML tags are and how they work. A visual editor which doesn't reformat the text and throw out formatting on every save would be a boon as well for those trying to create complex posts (see the goals of the Editor team to see the level of complexity @iseulde is &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i18DHwe3UZOIHW50jW21sTT-KBL4xso6NoSPtTKlv-I/edit#"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;targetting as sample posts&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://www.happycrossroads.com/trip-to-switzerland-2015/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;Trip to Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://www.nytimes.com/projects/2012/snow-fall/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;Snow Fall&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
which incidentally are directly lifted from &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/7281451/Medium-Editor-Exploration"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;Leigh Taylor's inspiration board&lt;/a&gt; for the new Medium editor, from back in February 2013.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Why in 2017 are we shipping second rate software? I'm facing coders quitting work as they are tired of working on WordPress as it's out of date technology which refuses to move into the modern era and runs like late 2009 software.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What will it take to wake core up to modern technology and better presentation? On the design side, core seems to want to stick to the indecipherable shades of grey design fad which has been poisoning readability on the internet for the last five years yet is already three years behind the times (current design is strong and simple colours with clear contrast).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let's try and get ahead of the wave or at least on it, ladies and gentlemen.
&lt;/p&gt;

@bor0 the problem isn't with the English string in core, but rather if the translated string from another language could potentially a character that would need to be escaped.

Ah :) figured to use &lt;code&gt;_e&lt;/code&gt; because we're using string literals but if that string changes in the future it can be an issue potentially. Submitting another patch in a few.

@bor0 small change, but &lt;code&gt;_e()&lt;/code&gt; in these cases should actually be &lt;code&gt;esc_attr_e()&lt;/code&gt; to ensure the translated string gets escaped for an HTML attribute context.

      <title>Ticket #39915 (is_email_address_unsafe() throws notice for invalid email addresses) updated</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
It looks like we can add some more test conditions to &lt;code&gt;is_email_address_unsafe()&lt;/code&gt;. We test a lot of addresses based on matching the list of banned domains, but we don't cover the case of an invalid email address.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Not sure about &lt;code&gt;is_email_address_unsafe()&lt;/code&gt;. Should the check be skipped if the email is invalid? Should it return true or false? Should we treat it as a domain only?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think if the email is invalid, then we should return &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; as "unsafe" in this case is whether or not it matches a banned list when a valid domain is provided.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
We discussed this in the accessibility meeting and have the following options and concerns
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;there should be a no-js fallback anyways
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;not all users might like the syntax highlighting
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;it might potentially introduce accessibility barriers
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the colours need to be checked for contrast and maybe adjustable
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;could slow load &amp;amp; rendering times
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;make it off by default or introduce a control to "switch" to the plain text editor
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
We gave this to the wpa11y test team to test.
We installed the patch with the codemirror on the test server and let them edit a template with this code editor.
I will report the results later, but what struck me the most was how worried blind content editors are, having the plain text editor changed and a new editor forced up unto them that adds extra clutter they didn't asked for.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And on a personal note:
It looks nice, if you are a coder and used to sublime text etc, but is there real value for the common user? It adds just ballast. Should WordPress provide this out of the box? Or is this plugin material. I think the latter.
&lt;/p&gt;

As discussed during today's bug scrub, we can move forward with this. Let's only focus on providing parity between the two ways of deactivating a site (users must not be removed from a site that is being deactivated from the site administration panel).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A separate ticket to make the terminology "Deactivate" vs "Delete" more clear should be opened as well. These changes should not be addressed here.

As a follow up, what causes the breakage is the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt; inside the For-Loop. Javascript that doesn't contain &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt; will work perfectly.

If I have a shortcode that outputs inline Javascript, placing a greater than arrow &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt; will cause the following code to break.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Example:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;
add_shortcode('output-javascript', function() {
    $output = "
        &amp;lt;script&amp;gt;

If you place this as a shortcut, it would be expected that the contents of &lt;code&gt;$output&lt;/code&gt; are displayed on the page. However, the closing &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag is stripped out. What is written to the page is this:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;
        &amp;lt;script&amp;gt;
            function getData() {
                for ( var i = 0; i &amp;lt; 5; i++ ) {
                    // run logic
                }
            }
            getData();
            console.log('&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Text&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Second Line of text');

This needs a refreshed patch, since we can safely make &lt;code&gt;_init_caps()&lt;/code&gt; private.

Replying to &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/37066#comment:7" title="Comment 7"&gt;rellect&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
37066.patch looks good. Thinking that 37066.2.patch would probably be slightly better as less backtracking in the regex (the logic is identical, just uses a callback instead of more complex regex).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Agreed, looks better. Added 37066.3 to correct a typo in the relevant comment.

      <title>Ticket #40048 (get_the_archive_description() doesn't address date archives) created</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;get_the_archive_description()&lt;/code&gt; gets a description for author and term-based archives (if one is available) but doesn't get a description for date archives.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In contrast, &lt;code&gt;get_the_archive_title()&lt;/code&gt; will get a title for everything that's an archive.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;get_the_archive_description()&lt;/code&gt; could benefit from an enhancement.
&lt;/p&gt;

No, I believe this is a distinct issue.  While our configuration also has a different siteurl from home, This issue doesn't affect all browsers like &lt;a class="assigned ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39128" title="#39128: defect (bug): Customize: Preview fails to load when domain mapping in use ... (assigned)"&gt;#39128&lt;/a&gt; - and we're not seeing the &lt;code&gt;Non-existent changeset UUID&lt;/code&gt; error.  Chrome and Firefox are operating normally, and Safari only is affected.  IE is untested on my end.
&lt;/p&gt;

@karmatosed can we discuss this on the contributors day in WCLND?
About the consequences of having link on hover and focus underlined?

Discussed this in the accessibility meeting today, and have concluded that there's no benefit at this time to attempting to resolve issues with cross-browser support for input element styles, but any styles that WordPress imposes need to be compliant with WCAG 2.0 color guidelines where they are applied.
&lt;/p&gt;

Not sure whether the &lt;code&gt;break;&lt;/code&gt; after the first switch statement is explicitly needed as it is preceded by a return.

The &lt;code&gt;WP_Post&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;WP_User&lt;/code&gt; classes allow getting a meta value by calling its getter function, eg. &lt;code&gt;$post-&amp;gt;my_meta_key&lt;/code&gt;. This functionality was omitted when introducing the &lt;code&gt;WP_Term&lt;/code&gt; class.

I don't think themes that haven't been updated in 2 years show up in search results, and we've required that themes be translation ready for 2 years now: &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2014/12/09/theme-review-team-weekly-notes-the-logs-are-3/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2014/12/09/theme-review-team-weekly-notes-the-logs-are-3/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, it should probably safe at this point to remove the tag as it's a standard feature.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I found there is no way to change password length param of wp_generate_password function.
I found there is no filter to extend the password length.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
there should be one filter so that if anyone want to extend password length during user registration they could.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
ref: wp-includes/user.php
line number : 2343
Function name: register_new_user()
&lt;/p&gt;

Entered this:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt; &amp;lt;area shape="poly" coords="77,57,276" data-content="&amp;lt;a href=//google.com&amp;gt;link&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; some other content. Be careful with using the right quotes here!" title="Some title"&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
converted to this:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;&amp;lt;area shape="poly" coords="77,57,276" data-content="&amp;lt;a href=//google.com&amp;gt;link&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; some other content. Be careful with using the right quotes here!&amp;amp;#8221; title=&amp;amp;#8221;Some title&amp;amp;#8221;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Is it really so difficult to leave the content of the "Text" mode as it is?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Just to remind you, that W3C says "attributes on HTML elements may have any string value".
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #40044 (A little strange logic in get_header_video_url() function) updated</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Oh, now I see that the code is change a littele in 4.7.3  &lt;a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/src/wp-includes/theme.php#L1328"&gt;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/src/wp-includes/theme.php#L1328&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But the logic still strange...
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And see next to the function &lt;code&gt;the_header_video_url()&lt;/code&gt; code: &lt;a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/src//wp-includes/theme.php#L1366"&gt;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/src//wp-includes/theme.php#L1366&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;function the_header_video_url() {
        $video = get_header_video_url();
        if ( $video ) {
                echo esc_url( $video );
        }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Why we esc the value of &lt;code&gt;get_header_video_url()&lt;/code&gt; one more time? It's already escaped...
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I actually agree with you, regarding features 2 and 3. Those features could even be plugins if  WordPress ever implemented "core" plugins vs. just one of 50,000+ from the repo.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But feature 1 needs to be on all sites that support WordPress comments, and features 2 and 3 need to exist in a form that most WordPress users will trust &lt;em&gt;(e.g. a "core" plugin)&lt;/em&gt; or this entire proposal really becomes moot.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think that we are largely in agreement then. I think it probably will make sense for WordPress's comments to accept annotation references out of the box, since annotations are a now a web standard.  I guess most of my concern was about 2 (and possibly 3).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Could you explain why you think that it is so important for 2 and 3 to exist in a "core" plugin/form most users will trust? As opposed to so many other features (forums, storefronts, etc.). (If you've already done that, then apparently I'm just not listening, so don't bother repeating yourself. :-)

Replying to &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/33381#comment:128" title="Comment 128"&gt;aristath&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In 2010 WordPress dropped support for PHP4 so this is not unheard of: &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://wordpress.org/news/2010/07/eol-for-php4-and-mysql4/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://wordpress.org/news/2010/07/eol-for-php4-and-mysql4/&lt;/a&gt;
I'm sure was a process for this... Why don't we just follow a similar process now?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yes, I actually intended to mention that before. I was not around yet back then, but I've heard some of the core devs talk about it before, and apparently it didn't go too well. I'm kind of shady on the details though.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think that it would still be helpful to take a look at the process used, even though we probably &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; want to follow it now, just to understand what went wrong so we can avoid repeating the same mistake. (Which is why the devs are so hesitant here: they are afraid that many of the proposals would just end up repeating the same mistake.)

        <dc:creator>Tkama</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Mon, 06 Mar 2017 12:41:33 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40044</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40044/1488804093722051</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Lets see func code here: &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_header_video_url/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_header_video_url/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;function get_header_video_url() {
    $id = absint( get_theme_mod( 'header_video' ) );
    $url = esc_url( get_theme_mod( 'external_header_video' ) );
    if ( ! $id &amp;amp;&amp;amp; ! $url ) {
        return false;
    }
    if ( $id ) {
        // Get the file URL from the attachment ID.
        $url = wp_get_attachment_url( $id );
    }
    return esc_url_raw( set_url_scheme( $url ) );
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;// at the bigining
$url = esc_url( get_theme_mod( 'external_header_video' ) );
// at the end
return esc_url_raw( set_url_scheme( $url ) );
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
May be better to do esc only just before return (variant 1). Or if we dont need it for wp_get_attachment_url() do esc_url_raw() only for it (variant 2)...
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And also it seems better to improve all logic, in order it become more clear an faster in some cases...
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
variant 1:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;function get_header_video_url() {
    $id = get_theme_mod( 'header_video' ); // absint( $id ) - no need
    if ( $id ) {
        // Get the file URL from the attachment ID.
        $url = wp_get_attachment_url( $id );
    }
    else {
        $url = get_theme_mod( 'external_header_video' );
    }
    if ( ! $url ) {
        return false;
    }
    return esc_url( $url );
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
variant 2:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;function get_header_video_url() {
    $id = get_theme_mod( 'header_video' ); // absint( $id ) - no need
    if ( $id ) {
        // Get the file URL from the attachment ID.
        $url = esc_url_raw( wp_get_attachment_url( $id ) );
    }
    else {
        $url = esc_url( get_theme_mod( 'external_header_video' ) );
    }
    if ( ! $url ) {
        return false;
    }
    return $url;
}

We should add nonce into comment form as hidden field by deafult.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We also have a patch already

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
The only part of this test that we should skip is the fixture generation.  The assertions there are still valuable.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I didn't see a clear way to accomplish this when I was working on it.  Maybe we want to refactor this into two separate tests - one that does the assertions and another (skippable) test that does the fixture generation?
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #40042 (Empty Author ID on first time action pre_get_post is called.) updated</title>
      
        <dc:creator>BackuPs</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Mon, 06 Mar 2017 11:14:40 GMT</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Note: I am talking about the author page listing all his posts he created.  The only way to get to the user meta is by the user id. But that id is missing from the query.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The code is pretty simple but does not work as the author field has no info about the id and thus cant work.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;set_user_pagination&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$query&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;is_admin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;is_author&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;is_main_query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$author_id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;get_query_var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'author'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;empty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$author_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$pagination&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;get_the_author_meta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'pagination'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$author_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//$pagination= get_user_meta($author_id, 'pagination', true);
&lt;/span&gt;                        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;empty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$pagination&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                                &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'posts_per_page'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$pagination&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;add_action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'pre_get_posts'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'set_user_pagination'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Now i know i can code around this issue. But the question is why in the first time the action is called the $query does not have the user id set?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;function set_user_pagination( $query ) {
	if (is_admin()) return;
	if (is_author() &amp;amp;&amp;amp; $query-&amp;gt;is_main_query()) {
		$author_id = get_query_var('author');
		if (empty($author_id)) $author_id=get_query_var('author_name');
		if (!is_numeric($author_id) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; !empty($author_id)) {
			$authorname=$author_id;
			$author_id='';
			$user = get_user_by( 'login', $authorname);
			if (isset($user-&amp;gt;ID)) $author_id=$user-&amp;gt;ID;
		}
		if (!empty($author_id)) {
			$pagination= get_user_meta($author_id, 'pagination', true);
			if (!empty($pagination)) {
				$query-&amp;gt;set( 'posts_per_page', $pagination );
			}
		}
	}
}
add_action( 'pre_get_posts', 'set_user_pagination' );
&lt;/pre&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Hi
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I want to set pagination for authors by grabbing a field which is attached to the user record.  But the first time the action is called in pre_get_posts $query only has a username. And that is the only moment one can set the $query-&amp;gt;set( 'posts_per_page', XXXX ); where XXX is the amount set for that user.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So i can only do this hardcoded. But i want to be able to call the user meta by its id and set the amount of posts by that setting.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a style="padding:0; border:none" href="http://i.imgur.com/2IaFTeC.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://i.imgur.com/2IaFTeC.png" alt="http://i.imgur.com/2IaFTeC.png" crossorigin="anonymous" title="http://i.imgur.com/2IaFTeC.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
How to work around this? Why is the author ID not set and only the name?
&lt;/p&gt;

Hi,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thanks for the prompt response and great feedback.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Following your notes, our team will make the following changes:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Documentation: We will expand the documentation to include additional features that are not yet mentioned, and meet the oEmbed standard.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Response:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Match the response type (rich) to the oEmbed standard
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add support to maxwidth and maxheight, as well as add support for the &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://&lt;/a&gt; scheme
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Match content type to the requested format
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;For xml: application/xml
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For Json: application/json
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Updated should be ready in time for our next release.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
In 2010 WordPress dropped support for PHP4 so this is not unheard of: &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://wordpress.org/news/2010/07/eol-for-php4-and-mysql4/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://wordpress.org/news/2010/07/eol-for-php4-and-mysql4/&lt;/a&gt;
I'm sure was a process for this... Why don't we just follow a similar process now?
&lt;/p&gt;

Thanks for all the patches :)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
@NomNom99, @vishalkakadiya, and @yahil could you all please refresh your patches from the "root" of the repo please.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/40039/40039-twentyeleven.patch" title="Attachment '40039-twentyeleven.patch' in Ticket #40039"&gt;40039-twentyeleven.patch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/40039/40039-twentyeleven.patch" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt; shows the full path in the diff to the file location:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;src/wp-content/themes/twentyten/&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Including the full path is easier for everyone to checkout the patch to both test and when and if needed to commit :)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There's some docs on working with patches in our handbook:

      <title>Ticket #39973 (Adding playbuzz.com as an oEmbed provider) updated</title>
      
        <dc:creator>swissspidy</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Mon, 06 Mar 2017 08:42:32 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39973#comment:3</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39973#comment:3/1488789752172849</guid>
      <description>&lt;i&gt;Keywords&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Is its oEmbed endpoint clearly established and properly documented? (Sometimes, they are just a developer’s pet project that may not be supported.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I found the documentation to be rather minimal. For example, the XML format is supported, but it's not documented. JSON responses are served with a &lt;code&gt;text/html&lt;/code&gt; mime type instead of &lt;code&gt;application/json&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;maxwidth&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;maxheight&lt;/code&gt; parameters to not work, but &lt;code&gt;width&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;height&lt;/code&gt; do. It works over HTTPS, but not all links in the response use &lt;code&gt;//&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;https://&lt;/code&gt; schemes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It would be great to have a patch to show that these points aren't obstacles for inclusion in WordPress core. The patch could be based off the Playbuzz plugin: &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/playbuzz/tags/0.9.6/oembed.php"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/playbuzz/tags/0.9.6/oembed.php&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Hey there,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thanks for  your report and the proposed fix! Would you mind creating a patch file for it? See &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/tutorials/working-with-patches/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/tutorials/working-with-patches/&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A unit test displaying the wrong behaviour would be great too, if possible.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
This is basically only an issue if plugins filter an individual post out using permissions. We should document this behaviour, but I don't see that there's a great way to "fix" it (i.e. always return the number you asked for). It's similar to requesting 10 items, but only 7 exist (i.e. small site, or at the end of pagination). The &lt;code&gt;per_page&lt;/code&gt; value is an upper-bound only.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;i&gt;Keywords&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Version&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Adding &lt;code&gt;reporter-feedback&lt;/code&gt; to indicate that the ticket needs more info.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Also, the &lt;code&gt;version&lt;/code&gt; field of a ticket should be set to the WP version where a feature or bug was first introduced.  You can think of it as "version relevant since", and we should probably document this better.  Going with 3.5 as the first version of the "modern" gallery shortcode ( &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Gallery_Shortcode"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;ref&lt;/a&gt;).

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Why?  (What are the benefits of supporting this?)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
How?  (What changes would need to be made?  Are there BC implications?)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Are there reasons &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; to do this?  For example:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I suspect it would mean that the &lt;code&gt;gallery&lt;/code&gt; shortcode has these extra features that aren't really supported in other shortcodes, which isn't great (something something xkcd something standards).  It might be better to consider schema or programmatic support as part of a larger project (for example, editor blocks), but the benefits would have to be pretty clearly explained and ideally proven.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Would we be adding (more) duplicate ways of doing the same thing, which is potentially confusing?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I don't have answers to these, just trying to ask questions that can help move the ticket forward.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I think we should add filters to allow short-circuiting these queries, since there is not an obvious solution that will work for every site (at least it's not obvious to me from the discussion above).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/31071/media.php.diff" title="Attachment 'media.php.diff' in Ticket #31071"&gt;media.php.diff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/31071/media.php.diff" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt; from @sboisvert looks sound to me but needs some stylistic clean-up before commit.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thoughts?
&lt;/p&gt;

I had a longer reply, but I cut it down to just this:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;"most people would be using it to set up a traditional website, and other people would be using it to set up an annotation server, possibly more-or-less linked to a traditional website."&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I actually agree with you, regarding features 2 and 3. Those features could even be plugins if  WordPress ever implemented "core" plugins vs. just one of 50,000+ from the repo.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But feature 1 needs to be on all sites that support WordPress comments, and features 2 and 3 need to exist in a form that most WordPress users will trust &lt;em&gt;(e.g. a "core" plugin)&lt;/em&gt; or this entire proposal really becomes moot.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Mon, 06 Mar 2017 02:28:07 GMT</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
@jnylen0 Sorry for the delay - I agree we should have tests for &lt;code&gt;post_name__in&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;post_parent__in&lt;/code&gt; for coverage as well as for contributors' reference, since the translation magic happening in &lt;code&gt;WP_REST_Posts_Controller&lt;/code&gt; may confuse things a bit. So I went ahead and attached the remaining tests.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I noticed that a test for the &lt;code&gt;post_name__in&lt;/code&gt; query with no order specified already exists in &lt;code&gt;tests/post/query.php&lt;/code&gt; via ticket # 36515. So I added two more tests, for the &lt;code&gt;post_name__in&lt;/code&gt; query with order 'asc' and 'desc'. The behavior is the same as with &lt;code&gt;post_in&lt;/code&gt; - no difference in returned order between the two. I added the tests in &lt;code&gt;tests/post/results.php&lt;/code&gt; but could also relocate them to be grouped with the already existing one in &lt;code&gt;tests/post/query.php&lt;/code&gt;, let me know what you think.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As for the &lt;code&gt;post_parent__in&lt;/code&gt; query, there is a test in &lt;code&gt;tests/query/results.php&lt;/code&gt; which specifies order 'asc'. I added the remaining test with order 'desc' in the latest diff.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;code&gt;wpautop&lt;/code&gt; function replaces double line-breaks with paragraph elements. It's executed on various items of content. Post content and term descriptions (used in category descriptions) are some examples.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I believe the author bio would benefit from &lt;code&gt;wpautop&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

In general, when core doesn't use the field I don't see the benefit in pulling it out - however it is an official field by the themes team.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As a workaround, Theme Check uses the filter to add the extra headers: &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/20897" title="#20897: defect (bug): extra_theme_headers hook no longer available (closed: fixed)"&gt;#20897&lt;/a&gt;

37066.patch looks good. Thinking that 37066.2.patch would probably be slightly better as less backtracking in the regex (the logic is identical, just uses a callback instead of more complex regex).
&lt;/p&gt;

IMHO changing older bundled themes doesn't gain much benefit, but we should ensure that Twenty Seventeen is consistently sticking to the guideline.

 ..."&gt;r34887&lt;/a&gt; closing PHP tags have been removed from PHP files and is now a &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/php/#remove-trailing-spaces"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;documented coding standard&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;""Omitting the closing PHP tag at the end of a file is preferred. If you use the tag, make sure you remove trailing whitespace."&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://secure.php.net/manual/en/language.basic-syntax.phptags.php"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;PHP manual states&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;"If a file is pure PHP code, it is preferable to omit the PHP closing tag at the end of the file. This prevents accidental whitespace or new lines being added after the PHP closing tag, which may cause unwanted effects because PHP will start output buffering when there is no intention from the programmer to send any output at that point in the script."&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Themes that exclude closing PHP tags: Twenty Fourteen and Twenty Seventeen
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Themes that include closing PHP tags: Twenty Ten, Eleven, Twelve, Thirteen, Fifteen, and Sixteen
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Should the closing PHP tags be removed from the above themes?
&lt;/p&gt;
