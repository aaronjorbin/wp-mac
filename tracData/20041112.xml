The date that DST switches is different in many places around the world. The time at which it switches also varies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I believe time is undefined during the hour (or whatever?) that DST switches (back? forward? I can't find the reference right now).
&lt;/p&gt;

Yeah, it's probably a duplicate...
Some notes:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;yes, i think, recalculating timezone everytime for every post isn't that cool (you've already said why).
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I believe, there's a fixed date (last something) when people switch from/to DST. I don't think we need additional fields for that;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've also been thinking about displaying the GMT offset in posts. However, i think it wouldn't look nice in that case..
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;WP should know however, that, say, 03:29 +0200 is earlier than 03:15 +0300. Yesterday, when i manually switched my timezone, WP didn't allow posting comments for me for an hour, telling me, that i can only post comments every 10 or more seconds. That should be fixed.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #169 (get_links_list() in wp-includes/links.php ignores $text_after_link settings) updated</title>

I'm bumping this because it was addressed in links.php CVS 1.12.4.1 but removed in 1.12.4.2
&lt;/p&gt;

Possible duplicate to &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://mosquito.wordpress.org/view.php?id=432"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://mosquito.wordpress.org/view.php?id=432&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I can't see any reason to change the date/time or apply an offset for every existing post or comment. That would create a "ripple in time" at every DST change which could affect permalinks or even just a reader's idea of when things really happened. A check box by itself would have the same effect as editing the offset in the admin as it stands now.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It would be nice to display something indicating the actual timezone/DST-text/UTC-offset of when each entry is made.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One way would be to have the option to set, in addition to UTC offset, dates to change to/from DST (including the ability to specify something like "the last Sunday in October"), how many minutes and (plus or minus) the DST offset is, and to set an author-specified timezone text (of their choosing). Time zones and DST are very complicated, but this might be a slightly less complicated way of accomodating this need and might aid in i18n and l10n.
&lt;/p&gt;

Recently, a great part of the world had a switch to daylight savings. It seems like WP isn't quite capable of that.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First, i had to manually change GMT offset to update it to the current one, and second (even more weird) -- the dates (at least, the displayed dates of today's comments) haven't changed accordingly. I consider it as a bug.
&lt;/p&gt;
