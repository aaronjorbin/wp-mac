      <title>Ticket #2775 (Ability for all users to add users with less capabilities) updated</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
What's the status of this ticket?  Is the metacaps.diff going to be committed?  +1 to the latest patch, btw, I like the array method much better, less messy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If I understand correctly, this patch and plugin will prevent an "Editor" with the "edit_users" ability from editing anything about an "Administrator", correct?  It will also allow an "Editor" to create a user of an equal or lesser role?  If so, this is exactly what I'm looking for.  Thank you.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The create_users and delete_users capabilities are going away now, I hope.  As it stands in trunk, they are completely redundant/useless caps with/without edit_users.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I smell a new version of Roles Manager.  Maybe the introduction of a new "edit_roles" cap?
&lt;/p&gt;

Thanks Mark... Regex is one of the last surviving &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;dark&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; arts :)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Having tested this fix a little more its not the only reason why podcasting won't work.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
the do_enclose() function does not actually seem to get called when running from an HTTPS site. and even when you hack the enclosure custom tag in the post (with the correct values as well), itunes moans that there was a problem - quite possibly it does not like HTTPS because nothing gets populated in any of the fields.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The feed is identical in XML though.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thought I had it for a moment there. But at least when you force the do_enclose() call it does populate the headers now :)
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
The HTML source editor of Wordpress in Opera 9 is broken. After editing the HTML and clicking on the 'Update' button, all of the text and html is erased. This occurs with the latest version of Wordpress 2.

      <title>Ticket #2877 (A Slash too much @ get_pagenum_link()) created</title>
      
        <author>dave@…</author>

      <pubDate>Thu, 29 Jun 2006 17:47:30 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2877</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2877/1151603250000000</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;File: template-functions-links.php
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Function: get_pagenum_link()
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The following code is at the end of the function:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;	// showing /page/1/ or ?paged=1 is redundant
	if ( 1 === $pagenum ) {
		$qstr = str_replace('page/1/', '', $qstr); // for mod_rewrite style
		$qstr = remove_query_arg('paged', $qstr); // for query style
	}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If you work with the mod_rewrite style, you will get this URL for the first page:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://www.example.com/wordpress/index.php/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://www.example.com/wordpress/index.php/&lt;/a&gt;
This wont work (/ at the end).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Correx:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;	// showing /page/1/ or ?paged=1 is redundant
	if ( 1 === $pagenum ) {
		$qstr = str_replace('/page/1/', '', $qstr); // for mod_rewrite style
		$qstr = remove_query_arg('paged', $qstr); // for query style
	}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Notes:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;sry for my bad english...
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;i've downloaded a german translation of wordpress 2.0.3, so maybe its just in this version... ?!

Oh, ok..I have now tried it with the javascript off, and it will delete it while "Editing" the comment, but when doing it this route: Manage =&amp;gt; Comments =&amp;gt; Delete
,it will show a message: "Oops, no post with this ID. Go back!"

It would be great to be able to create sub-categories for the WP links system.  This would allow bloggers to further categorize large collections of links and directories.

In regex, the question mark makes the previous item optional... so https? matches http or https
&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2875</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2875/1151577351000000</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I was noticeing a problem in that when you post on a standard HTML site, enclosures get added into postmeta on publishing a post. When running off an HTTPS site, this no longer happens.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The reason is the regex only looks for HTTP. Line 1032 of wp-includes/functions.php
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;  preg_match_all("{\b http : [$any] +? (?= [$punc] * [^$any] | $)}x", $content, $post_links_temp2);
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Add the following under this line and it works.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;  preg_match_all("{\b https : [$any] +? (?= [$punc] * [^$any] | $)}x", $content, $post_links_temp2);
  foreach($post_links_temp2[0] as $link) {
    $post_links_temp[0][] = $link;
  }
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
There may be a nicer way to regex that up, but I couldn't add it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I have raised it as high/major because it is a bit of a hole that I cannot override the functionality of, and I use the RSS feed for podcasting - which WordPress does not support from an HTTPS site.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I do not agree with this suggestion.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This cause WP to override any .htaccess files that are configured above the WordPress directory.  Additionaly, and it will make the upgrade process more difficult as this is a file that could be overwritten very easily when uploading an update.  If I lost my .htaccess file, it would require a good bit of scrambling to get the contents restored. (Which reminds me it is time for another backup....)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
AFAIK, .htaccess is only created by WordPress if you change your permalink structure.  So most installs rely on the .htaccess configured by there web provider.  1and1.com for instance has a special thing for converting the urls to upper or lower case as appropriate.  If I put a custem perma link structure, and thus create a .htaccess file, that behavior is lost.
&lt;/p&gt;

I've attached mirrorlinks.  All usual disclaimers regarding warranty or fitness apply.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Guys, I'm practically bending over to get you to see my point.  Please don't close yourselves up to the idea that my proposed patches may actually get WP one more use case, without breaking anything.  And of course, if you feel there's room for improvement, do suggest!  I'm here to help, not to bicker.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
We seem to diverge on this issue.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here are the technical reasons why I think your last post is flawed.  Note that I said "I think".
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In this context, "broken"'s definition is simply "assuming things that aren't necessarily true".  In this context again, the untrue assumption is that files can only have ONE path name, which is evidently FALSE on UNIX.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You said: "First plugin or auto-prepended script to do chdir breaks everything."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
No, no plugin can break anything in WP core by issuing a chdir(), since the getcwd() calls are executed before plugin execution - you can easily see the getcwd() calls are invoked right at the beginning of core engine load.  It also doesn't break the patch I submitted for widgets, since the Widgets plugin just uses siteurl, not getcwd().
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You said: "getcwd()'s value changes to be unusable with its context, for example during shutdown, where its value becomes "/" "
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now, this isn't affected by WP core + my patches.  As I said earlier, plugins should not use &lt;span class="underline"&gt;FILE&lt;/span&gt; to determine public URLs to submit to the browser, and this has nothing to do, absolutely, to what you just said.  I also DO NOT advocate to use the getcwd() technique to determine public URLs, as you can see from my patch to the Widgets plugin.  In summary, both &lt;span class="underline"&gt;FILE&lt;/span&gt; and getcwd() are broken.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You said "I still fail to"
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course, I can't reply to this. Your brush seems to be running out of pai
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
(the last sentence is a half-hearted joke ;-)

You can't really presume the destination server is running Apache or that the filename that the server is looking for has been changed from the default ".htaccess". Or even that .htaccess is enabled on the server, which be default it is not.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I do agree about WordPress not bothering to write to .htaccess if it doesn't need to, though.
&lt;/p&gt;

I just checked out the latest WordPress trunk (rev 3937) and after I went to change my admin password, after clicking Update User, the "« Back to Authors and Users" link didn't have any effect when clicking. It simply reloaded the same page. Clicking the already selected tab "Authors &amp;amp; Users" has the desired effect.

I'm not using any plugins that should cause a problem.  You are testing with a static page and not a post, right?

It seems to work properly with posts, but not static pages.

&lt;code&gt;Matt, what you just said about "other countless plugins" using the same technique... dude, that theory doesn't hold water. The theory that countless other plugins are broken (and in my personal supercharged 3rdparty plugin mishmash, so far I haven't found any that uses this technique) does NOT matter ZILCH in the face of the fact that Widgets also needs fixing. I respect your opinion, but the "other boys do the same brokenness as well" argument just doesn't fly with me :-)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It should float very well, but I hate how you assume that because some plugin does what the WP core does with no issue on a regular blog, it is therefore "broken". I'm not sure where you found your definition of broken, but they've been working pretty darn good for us for the past few months.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Your solution is twice as hackish than anything in the core right now, and is fundamentally broken a few ways. First plugin that does chdir() breaks everything. chrdir() is disabled on many servers for security reasons.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;First plugin or auto-prepended script to do chdir breaks everything.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;getcwd()'s value changes to be unusable with its context, for example during shutdown, where its value becomes "/"
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I still fail to

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
OK.  Let's recap.  This bug touches two different (and sensitive issues):
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ISSUE1:THEWP-CONFIGISSUEINWPCORE"&gt;ISSUE 1: THE WP-CONFIG ISSUE IN WP CORE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
say we have A: a pristine WP source dir
say we have B, C, D: three different Apache DocumentRoots, targets for WP
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
How can we work with a single source dir, instead of having to manually propagate changes from B into A, C, D?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Answer: UNIX symlinks.  Make B, C and D be full with folders and symlinks to A's contents, as an exact mirror.  Then place a wp-config.php file on B, C and D.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Results?  Edit a file in A, and B C D see the updates.  The same applies in all other directions.  Add one level of indirection (say, make A a mirror of a WP 2.0.3 source tree) and a bit of care, and you're set for nearly atomic WP updates (zero downtime) because you can later on swap A for A', which may be a symlink mirror of WP 2.1 source.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
(the actual case is actually much, much more complicated -- but fully automated now -- since I'm integrating disparate wp-contents, wp-content/themes and wp-content/plugins for each DocumentRoot, but this is the fundamental principle.  I only mention this to show that it isn't actually possible to build a conditional wp-config.php because the three sites must have different contents and some of those contents come from a disparate branch checkouts, but some of those contents are shared, including pristine WP core and a base of free plugins which undergo constant updates and bug fixes by me.  No, I can't start checking wp-configs.php into my SVN repos - that would be asking for real trouble with my customers in a few days - plus wp-config.php is CONFIG, not APP code - it doesn't just belong in an app repo.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The fact that WP includes wp-config.php using &lt;span class="underline"&gt;FILE&lt;/span&gt; which does not work when the WP source directory is a tree of symlinks, because for some reason &lt;span class="underline"&gt;FILE&lt;/span&gt; will point to the symlink target instead of the symlink.  Since &lt;span class="underline"&gt;FILE&lt;/span&gt; points to the real file, dirname(&lt;span class="underline"&gt;FILE&lt;/span&gt;) . "/../" usually points to the file's parent directory instead of the "symlink mirror dir" with the actual wp-config.php.  Obviously, wp-config.php does not exist in the actual source drop which is taken as a model to build the symlink mirror.  The *only* way to get wp-config.php is to look at the output of getcwd(), which apart from being faster than dirname() calls, actually uses the CWD (current working dir) - which is correct for symlink shadow copies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The tree of symlinks is used over here *a lot* to avoid duplication of files and work on single source checkouts (and it should also be used in large hosting farms, because this lets people upgrade their WP atomically - a big boon in large hosting farms again).  This in practice means that as I update one site's code, the others automatically get the fix, without me needing to manually merge changes in N repositories.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course, with a tree of symlinks, five or ten different Web sites can run from a single source checkout.  Imagine making N WP's running off N databases, without actually having to manage separate source drops...  BTW, If someone is reading this and wants to save a huge amount of disk space and money in his big, big WP deployment, sure, e-mail me (rudd-o at rudd-o dot com) and I'll do it for you at fair rates ;-).  I built the software to create and automate this task.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ISSUE2:PLUGINSUSINGTHEFILEMETHOD"&gt;ISSUE 2: PLUGINS USING THE &lt;span class="underline"&gt;FILE&lt;/span&gt; METHOD&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course, fixing wpcore was the easy part (a few greps and seds, and that's it).  But I later discovered that the Widgets plugin was not working on my newly setup blogs.  I couldn't drag or drop any sidebar widgets.  I took the time to inspect the source of the admin page, and, lo and behold, script language=javascript src=/home/rudd-o/Projects/Websites/...
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I said "what the HELL?  How can a plugin be issuing an HTML resource request with an absolute path?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The culprit was the source lines I changed on the plugin (you can see the diff).  What was going on?  Simple.  The widgets plugin was attempting to determine its wp-content public directory (to load the JS files) by str_replacing dirname(&lt;span class="underline"&gt;FILE&lt;/span&gt;) with get_settings(siteurl).  Forgetting for a moment that this is hackish (to say the least) and it might lead to problems under certain setups, I posit the following:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All plugins that use this method are broken.  BRO-KEN.  By design.  In other words, it's a really dumb idea.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Why?  Because str_replace(dirname&lt;span class="underline"&gt;FILE&lt;/span&gt; with siteurl) can't be assumed to yield the right URL.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;odd WP installation paths or Apache mappings can make the replacement useless
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;*of course* &lt;span class="underline"&gt;FILE&lt;/span&gt; may very well be a symlink, but &lt;span class="underline"&gt;FILE&lt;/span&gt; will point to the actual file.  If you have your WP source at /home/r/wpsource and you have your DocumentRoot be a symlink shadow, the replacement won't work at all.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Basically the Widgets plugin as it currently stands punts the issue, completely ignoring the fact that a file can have two completely ifferent paths on UNIX, and still be the same file.  PHP compounds the problem, of course.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The fix I submitted for the Widgets plugin was the most reasonable compromise I could find.  It still dynamically computes its installation directory (while it should actually be traversing *up* the dir hier to find wp-content and then use the children dirs - a technique I've seen successfully used in countless plugins, and a technique that actually yields much better results than the one used in Widgets).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Matt, what you just said about "other countless plugins" using the same technique... dude, that theory doesn't hold water.  The theory that countless other plugins are broken (and in my personal supercharged 3rdparty plugin mishmash, so far I haven't found any that uses this technique) does NOT matter ZILCH in the face of the fact that Widgets also needs fixing.  I respect your opinion, but the "other boys do the same brokenness as well" argument just doesn't fly with me :-)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ryan: your proposed solution can't work either because (if I understood you correctly) the actual source dir can't have a wp-config.php - it's a pristine source directory.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I actually don't see a problem with the changeset I submitted (at least for the WP core changes).  It's short, it does not touch large amounts of files, the changes it introduces are localized... I've tested it throughly and no bugs seemed to have arisen at all.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If anything, advanced sysadmins have gained a new choice (choice that of course why should be denied?).  As I already stated, using &lt;span class="underline"&gt;FILE&lt;/span&gt; in plugins to generate relative URLs in plugins is broken code that should not be relied upon and is asking for trouble.  They can of course just use getcwd() which throws correct results in all situations (except made for the wp-admin/ case where of course this can be tested for in a short one-liner or simply hard-coded depending on what the plugin wants to do).  By correct, I mean "what the sysadmin configured as DocumentRoot".
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sorry for such a longish reply.  I felt I had to explain the motivations in deep detail.  I also meant to call the attention of you guys to this seemingly okay &lt;span class="underline"&gt;FILE&lt;/span&gt; issue (most of the uses of &lt;span class="underline"&gt;FILE&lt;/span&gt; in WP are fine and dandy, and that's why you didn't see me changing them all - I just changed the ones pertaining to wp-config and of course the widgets plugin).
&lt;/p&gt;

Currently, you can change the size of the post textarea in Options -&amp;gt; Writing. However, this is a global setting; I think it'd be useful to allow users to override it with their own sizes should they wish.

After uploading the "latest" files from the branch/2.0 for 2.0.4-alpha, on my main blog, it seems to be working just fine for me. I had tried deleting a comment via Manage =&amp;gt; Comments =&amp;gt; Delete, and it deletes it, and I have also clicked on the Edit Comment button and deleted it that way as well. Seems go to go in my book. :)
