Don't forget the &lt;a class="wiki" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/wiki/WikiFormatting"&gt;WikiFormatting&lt;/a&gt; that Trac needs so your points don't run together.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
1) It's better than Magpie
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Where "better" means different, and parsing more types of feeds. Like all new code, I'm sure it has bugs and security problems. It is larger than phpmailer, snoopy, IXR, pop3, and KSES &lt;strong&gt;combined&lt;/strong&gt;. I'm sure it's fine code, but that's a lot of bulk for something that (1) generates very little complaints or support right now and (2) works for what we need it for.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
2) It makes it easier for plugin authors to write RSS-consuming plugins
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Plugin authors can and will bundle their own libraries. If the worst thing that happens is two RSS-consuming plugins bundle the same library, don't do a is_defined type check to see if it's already there, and are loaded at the same time, I don't see that as a big deal.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
3) It meets the "Code is Poetry" mantra of WP by providing clean and simple functions to do all the stuff a library should do. Magpie is just fugly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There is lots of nice code in the world, we shouldn't include it all. Our API functions in front of the library are going to stay the same anyway.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
4) Upgrading Simplepie is as clean as dropping an upgraded library into class-Simplepie.php. No fuss, no muss, no editing. Matt, why is upgrading hard?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Are you saying you've audited all 300k of that code?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
5) Provides WP a future-proofed method of consuming feeds in new and different ways not yet in this iteration of WP.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It's not actually future proof in any sense of the word. Historically feed formats have changed several times in the short lifetime of WP, and even the interpretation of feed elements have evolved over time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
6) Because feed consumption in a blogging software should not be relegated to "second rate" functionality or as additional pieces of flair. Feed consumption is _essential_ to blogging and blogging software.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Repeating yourself doesn't make it more true. If feed consumption was as essential as you say, and magpie was as broken as you suppose, then no one would use WP. Pick a side.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Write a great Simplepie plugin, put it in the plugin dir, and we can track its usage. If it's popular, that shows a market demand for it and we can look at bringing it into core. We're at the point in WP where we need to focus on improving the most-used parts, rather than adding a third of a megabyte for edge functionality.
&lt;/p&gt;

Oh, and one more thing: Google's mechanism is Javascript-only. It only works in the browser. I can't get data from a feed and, say, store it in the database or anything.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #4566 (Cron Not Getting Called (fsockopen failing)) updated</title>
      
        <dc:creator>Otto42</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Mon, 02 Jul 2007 19:09:58 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4566#comment:6</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4566#comment:6/1183403398000000</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
The reason for this fsockopen is to make the wp-cron.php file execute asynchronously, correct? There's other ways to do that, perhaps the program should try some of those other ways as well if one fails.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You could use &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://us.php.net/pcntl_fork"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;pcntl_fork&lt;/a&gt; to do it, if the PHP process is not running as an Apache module. Fortunately, pcntl_fork gives you feedback when it won't work (return value of -1).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Alternately, if nothing else works, you could just include the wp-cron.php file and make it run that way. Yes, it won't be asynchronous, but at least it'll work.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
As far as I can tell, the only one opposing this is Matt. It seems a bit like tags in 2.2. Matt, I don't know if you're just playing devil's advocate but either way, you're outnumbered.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My argument is much more philisophical. Otto makes a good case for the technical and practical side of the argument. However, from where I sit, feeds are becoming more about ubiquitous content. We don't know when, where, how or why content is being used and in what form it's being used. WP has done a good job of providing it's own content in a variety of formats. The reality is WP is also on the consuming side of content and we are bottlenecked right now. Plugin authors can't write plugins to do feed consummation effectively unless they bundle their own feed library and that on it's face is just silly when we already provide a library. Why should a plugin author have to bundle SimplePie when WP is offering Magpie? Quite simply, magpie sucks and by bundling both... well again, that's just silly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
WP should be offering Simplepie because
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
1) It's better than Magpie
2) It makes it easier for plugin authors to write RSS-consuming plugins
3) It meets the "Code is Poetry" mantra of WP by providing clean and simple functions to do all the stuff a library should do. Magpie is just fugly.
4) Upgrading Simplepie is as clean as dropping an upgraded library into class-Simplepie.php. No fuss, no muss, no editing. Matt, why is upgrading hard?
5) Provides WP a future-proofed method of consuming feeds in new and different ways not yet in this iteration of WP.
6) Because feed consumption in a blogging software should not be relegated to "second rate" functionality or as additional pieces of flair. Feed consumption is _essential_ to blogging and blogging software. Let's stop rying to pretend it can be worked around.
&lt;/p&gt;

+1 for getting this in asap. Just tested it against 1.1.2 and there is a huge performance increase. Also I haven't found anything that breaks with the new version, so adding it should be simple.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
(ps - Jquery site has been dugg, so a lot isn't accessible right now)

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Their API returns normalized data structures that are much easier to parse than RSS/Atom, and it's forward-compatible. I think it would give us the combined benefits of supporting all types of feeds current and future, no ongoing maintenance on our part, and reducing the size and complexity of what's bundled with WP.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Their API also doesn't give you any control, as it doesn't give you the actual content of the feed directly, it first goes through Google's once-an-hour-maximum caching mechanism and numerous other things. A lot of potentially useful data in the feed is also scrubbed in the process. In other words, you only get what Google supports, not the actual unadulterated feed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Frankly, I'd prefer an API that would give me the actual content of the feed that I am wanting to get, not some kind of weird thing that may or may not work for any particular application that I may or may not be using.
&lt;/p&gt;

I don't know his situation, but I would point out that if you do a Google Blog Search that includes a +, as an example, and try subscribing to the RSS feem the widget won't parse the URL. This tracks all the way back to the damn magpie library. But maybe his situation is different than mine.
&lt;/p&gt;

And, it should be able to be tweaked via a filter, I suppose.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'll admit to not being 100% familiar with filters. I believe I need something like...
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;$url = apply_filters('clean_url',$url);
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Anyhow, my question about wp_kses_bad_protocol() still stands. I think my original patch is correct. I've done some testing and it's the call to wp_kses_bad_protocol() that ensures that the scheme is one we allow. The code that appends &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://&lt;/a&gt; is provided merely as a convenience.

Something like this.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;$allowed_schemes = array('http://','https://','mailto:');
if(substr( $url, 0, 1 ) != '/' &amp;amp;&amp;amp; !preg_match('/^[a-z0-9-]+?\.php/i', $url)){
    $foo = FALSE;
    foreach ($allowed_schemes as $s)
        {$foo = $foo || (strpos($url, $s) !== FALSE);}
    if (!$foo) $url = 'http://' . $url;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
but isn't wp_kses_bad_protocol() meant to filter out disallowed schemes?
&lt;/p&gt;

If we are to support other types of url in clean_url then they should be whitelisted.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
clean_url is used to sanitise things like commenter urls so we must ensure that things like javascript cannot be used to stop possible XSS attacks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ooh, yeah, like &lt;code&gt;javascript:alert(document.cookie)&lt;/code&gt; links.

Attached patch allows for @ to appear in URLs and doesn't presume that just beceause a URL doesn't contain ":&lt;em&gt;" that it an invalid URL and needs &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://&lt;/a&gt; appended (mailto:, news: and sip: for example).

Hi,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All categories Last-Modified dates are the same, and thats a one big rss file i guess.
Is there a chance to send individual Last-Modified dates to these feed ?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thanks

Both myself and the reporter have been unable to replicate this problem with trunk code in two different server environments. I can only presume that this is an issue that's already been resolved.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Personally I think that if someone cares this much about the version number appearing in the header then they won't find it at all difficult to work out how to remove it from the theme they're using.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This isn't the only place where bloginfo('version') is used in WordPress and crippling that function to achieve one particular task seems unwise.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I hate reopening tickets :-/...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
but i have to agree that pointing this is a "security feature" or "security related" matter its not totally right and also useless because if a hacker didn't find the version he will try all know exploits and also this is applicable to all bots or automated exploit tools.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But I propose to see this as a privacy feature (not security feature), some prefer to hide his version rather than just being output publicly, i know this could be done by just changing some of the version retriever code (most of them are in bloginfo functions in general-template.php and other related to feeds files) and obviously add and a option in Options &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Privacy (wp-admin/options-privacy.php) to turn off and on the version disclousure.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
IMHO this is better, let the user choose if he wants to display his version rather than just cutting off in all publicly view places...
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Using Google's AJAX API is certainly a possibility for the dashboard, however it doesn't solve the more generic problem of reading feeds for other purposes. It would be beneficial to have generic feed reading capabilities in Wordpress because there are many, many other reasons to read feeds than just displaying news on the dashboard.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Their API returns normalized data structures that are much easier to parse than RSS/Atom, and it's forward-compatible. I think it would give us the combined benefits of supporting all types of feeds current and future, no ongoing maintenance on our part, and reducing the size and complexity of what's bundled with WP.
&lt;/p&gt;

Determine why SimplePie requires PHP 4.3, and see if it is feasible to code a compatibility layer to keep WP requirements static.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As of &lt;a class="changeset" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/775" title="Make entity catch in sanitize_title ungreedy.
"&gt;r775&lt;/a&gt;, SP supports PHP4.1 and up.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Have SimplePie use existing DB caching system.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
In previous versions used I had no trouble adding a "mailto:blog@…" link in the sidebar to contact the blog's author.  In upgrading to 2.2.1 however, I cannot accomplish this using the blogroll (used to be "links") function.  An "&lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://&lt;/a&gt;" is added to and the "@" symbol does not take from the entered address.  I have tried variations in writing the e-mail address to no avail, and this seems like a basic function that should exist but that I cannot get to work.  It still may be me, but on the forum someone suggested I write a ticket for this problem, so maybe it is not just me.  Thank you.
&lt;/p&gt;

Isn't this fixed already? The sql used is...
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That's only hides private posts from the dashboard. The attached patch uses the same techique you mention to hide comments on private posts from the dashboard too.
&lt;/p&gt;

By the way, I have been trying to get a plugin to do this, but I'm not having much success. I just can't get the hang of cron. &lt;code&gt;:(&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

In &lt;code&gt;wp-comments-post.php&lt;/code&gt;, at the very top, there is a small instance of double quotes being used where single quotes should be used (performance), and spaces used when tabs should be used.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Patch attached is patched against trunk rev 5773.
&lt;/p&gt;

Calling localhost should be fine if you include the proper host: header.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Only if the apache or other httpd is listening on all interfaces which may not always be true on a multi-ip hosted server.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
As of the 2007-07-01 nightly build the &lt;em&gt;wp_list_categories&lt;/em&gt; template tag lists empty categories even when the &lt;em&gt;hide_empty&lt;/em&gt; parameter is explicitly set to &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt;. Using the &lt;em&gt;exclude&lt;/em&gt; parameter removes them from the list, but obviously that's not practical or ideal.
&lt;/p&gt;

My UI suggestion would be a simple drop down menu above the current category menu selection "window".
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I also have to say that, while I will not change the properties, I think this is a defect, as it does mess your permalink structure.  I feel this is just below blocker as a priority.  My guess that the major ramification is that this would be a one way database upgrade.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>wontfix: &lt;p&gt;
Upgrading my other two blogs from v2.12 to v.2.2 -- so all all symmetric again -- seems to have solved the problem.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It's a mystery -- but probably not worth putting any effort into figuring out.
&lt;/p&gt;
