Going with the first option -- make comment walker behave like the others -- (a.k.a my original approach) the attached patch adds use of $output throughout the class. It also wraps the two instances of user callbacks with output buffering, and adds the output parameter and output buffering to the new ping(), comment(), and html5_comment() functions. Autodocs also updated.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Currently converting my patch to SCSS - I don't like it. Syntax sucks, and you can't overload mixins - meaning, you can't have multiple versions of a mixin that take a different number of arguments. I don't think the libsass argument means we should pick one or the other just because of the code it compiles on top of. I fully thought SASS was going to better, it was just something I hadn't looked at yet - I think the latest version of LESS is cleaner with better docs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As it stands right now, SASS by default compiles via Ruby gem - a lateral move from NodeJS. No matter what the method of development, at the end, someone's going to have to push a button that compiles the code so they can run it in the browser.
&lt;/p&gt;

Will it still be possible to see the actual result of a patch with a pre-processor? This is a must, because the real CSS is the code we have to review.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Although, I guess that's still possible with ​lessphp
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I would be cautious about lessphp. It's a fine port, but it lags behind in updates. Also original LESS implementation allows to embed generic JavaScript transparently and that doesn't play well with ports to different languages.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I've used to compile LESS in PHP (via wp-less plugin mentioned above in the thread), but moved away from it in favor of compilation by IDE in development.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;code&gt;WP_User&lt;/code&gt; class has a function called &lt;code&gt;get_role_caps()&lt;/code&gt; that is compiling a list with all user capabilities (coming from roles or individual).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It's a great function, but it's just setting the &lt;code&gt;allcaps&lt;/code&gt; object field which has to be taken additionally. For me it makes sense to get that list returned to the user for further use if needed and I was expecting to get the data as a function result (the function starts with 'get' anyway).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Applying a patch for returning the field data from the function.
&lt;/p&gt;

Agree with @DrewAPicture, that's why we have support for editor-style.css in themes, so the editor is more wysiwyg.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I think it would be very much worth considering having a custom installer written specifically for core and released by WordPress (e.g. &lt;code&gt;wordpress/wordpress-core-installer&lt;/code&gt;). This would get around the need to shoehorn core into the &lt;code&gt;wordpress-plugin&lt;/code&gt; package type while still allowing us to set it as a &lt;code&gt;wordpress-core&lt;/code&gt; type to get it into a custom directory other than &lt;code&gt;vendor/wordpress/wordpress&lt;/code&gt;. This would let us control the install process as much as we need to. Also, should installation options ever change in the future (I don't know how, but I don't pretend to know how things will change years down the road), we could adapt as needed by just bumping the installer's version.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And of course, if someone wants to use WordPress as the web root package, thus sacrificing the ability to upgrade core with Composer, there is always the &lt;code&gt;composer create-project wordpress/wordpress&lt;/code&gt; command.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Point of order: I only used LESS because I don't know SASS or SaaaaassyCSS. It would probably be easy for someone to just search and replace my vars and mixins and change them to the alt syntax
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #10948 (wp_list_comments() always assumes walker will echo.) updated</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Every other walker in core sets $output instead of directly echoing. I feel like Walker_Comment is doing it wrong and should be updated to do it properly. We would need to add an output buffer around the callback trigger in start_el() and such.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The only other issue is if someone is extending Walker_Comment, especially only some of it. I am not sure what would happen then.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, do we:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Try to make the walker work more like all other walkers.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add output buffering to where the walker is called.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;??
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I'm fine with committing &lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/10948/10948.diff" title="Attachment '10948.diff' in Ticket #10948"&gt;10948.diff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/10948/10948.diff" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt; but it would still be nice to look at the walker inconsistencies.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Since there's more activity on this again lately, I figure it's a good time to update everyone on recent developments on SASS since they might be relevant here.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since this ticket was first opened, there is now a sponsored effort working towards the &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/hcatlin/libsass"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;libsass&lt;/a&gt; project, opening up non-ruby implementations, and eventually replacing the ruby version altogether way down the road (with a ruby binding on libsass). In fact, there's also already at least two PHP &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/jamierumbelow/sassphp"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;libsass&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/bzick/php-sass"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;bindings&lt;/a&gt; I've found in the works, and while they are still incredibly young, unstable, and mostly unusable, this is the direction we're headed with eventually including a SASS compiler as a built-in PHP extension without any other external dependencies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course, this is all still a *long* way away (I'd say about 8 to 10 years) from being something WP could take advantage of for core development, but it's not like core devs wouldn't already have to install additional tools to compile LESS anyway. However, when we break it down there, installing lessc frequently gets new devs caught up with installing npm/node/etc, but with SASS we will have a command line tool written in C, built on libsass much sooner that doesn't have any other dependencies. We would be looking at native platform binaries with super simple installers and distro packages, no extra npm package management and environment configuration.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you follow development on these projects much, you might find one of the latest podcast interviews with the inventor of SASS and founder of libsass interesting that covers much of this work: &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://5by5.tv/changelog/94"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://5by5.tv/changelog/94&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There isn't any effort along these lines for LESS (at least JS is already much more portable than Ruby anyway).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As for my opinion...
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When I compare the two precompilers, I generally agree the most with &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://css-tricks.com/sass-vs-less/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;this comparison of the language features&lt;/a&gt;. So when I take the above developments into consideration along with the comparisons on language features (which I find SASS is much stronger in due mostly to limitations of the browser-side LESS compiler holding LESS back), it's still easy to consider LESS for tiny, quick projects, but not for large-scale projects like this with many collaborators. There's a huge benefit to making use of the Compass library for SASS for WordPress core too, assuming it's not too much to ask for newbie devs and designers to learn and really make good use of anyway.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
@dd32 may have also nailed it too:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Replying to &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/22862#comment:5" title="Comment 5"&gt;dd32&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It also seems obvious that we'd want to implement a pre-processor which is written in PHP for maximum flexibility and server-side regeneration during development.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Although, I guess that's still possible with &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/leafo/lessphp"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;lessphp&lt;/a&gt;, it would just be a pity to have to bundle that somewhere unless we also got around to &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/23912"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;adopting composer&lt;/a&gt;.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
There is also wp_iframe() and probably a few other places where we have a &amp;lt;body&amp;gt; element and should also have a .rtl class.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
editimage.html might be the one place where you won't be able to externally style.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
this fix could mirror the current fix applied to &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/wp-signup.php#L35"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;wp-signup.php found on line 35&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I added a filter to the wp_title function that outputs a more descriptive generic title but this could go either way.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If this fix seems to be the best way to approach it currently, it may be worth going back to wp-signup.php and adjusting it to follow a similar pattern.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #24961 (No error message when logging in without cookies enabled) created</title>
      
        <dc:creator>agoranet</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Mon, 05 Aug 2013 21:02:39 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24961</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24961/1375736559838399</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Trying to log in with cookies disabled exhibits the following behavior:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Logging in as admin or user using incorrect username and/or password = error message "Cookies are blocked..." displayed along with error message about login information being incorrect
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Logging in as admin or user using the correct username and password = no error messages at all
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In the second case, we would expect that the error message "Cookies are blocked..." would still be displayed. Instead the page just reloads to the login screen with no indication of what went wrong with the login.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We tried deactivating all plugins and using the default theme, but still saw the issue. We can reproduce the issue as far back as Wordpress 3.2 on various sites.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #24960 (Multisite activation page header shows as "Page Not Found") created</title>

      <pubDate>Mon, 05 Aug 2013 20:39:04 GMT</pubDate>

      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24960/1375735144953026</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
When activating a new user the header for wp-activate.php renders the title as "Page Not Found" and returns a status code of 404.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This appears to be the case with an activation key or without.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The attached patch modifies the file to unset the 404 status and apply a generic title to all versions of the page.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #22862 (Consider a CSS preprocessor) updated</title>
      
        <dc:creator>wonderboymusic</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Mon, 05 Aug 2013 20:37:04 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/22862#comment:33</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/22862#comment:33/1375735024702571</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
So I took a big bite out of this....
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/22862/22862.diff" title="Attachment '22862.diff' in Ticket #22862"&gt;22862.diff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/22862/22862.diff" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;code&gt;wp-admin.css&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;wp-admin.min.css&lt;/code&gt; compiled by LESS. I broke up the admin styles from one 10,000 line file into 32 modules. The structure is like so:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;/wp-admin/css/wp-admin.css
/wp-admin/css/wp-admin.min.css
/wp-admin/css/less/wp-admin.less // manifest file
/wp-admin/css/less/variables.less
/wp-admin/css/less/mixins.less
/wp-admin/css/less/modules/* &amp;lt;--- the 32 modules
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I rewrote the entire &lt;code&gt;wp-admin.css&lt;/code&gt; in LESS syntax. There are still probably a billion things that could be done, but you'll get the gist. I only made one variable, but I made a bunch of mixins.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To compile the code from LESS to CSS, &lt;code&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;/wp-admin/css/less&lt;/code&gt; directory and then:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;lessc wp-admin.less &amp;gt; ../wp-admin.css
lessc wp-admin.less --yui-compress &amp;gt; ../wp-admin.min.css
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I am sure I broke stuff, but I did a bunch of testing to make sure everything appears like it wasn't broken by my test.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My immediate reactions after doing this:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is an ungodly amount of CSS
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Splitting it up into modules is the easiest to optimize by feature
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;LESS shows us when our nesting levels are way too deep. Google PageSpeed generally recommends only 2 levels deep max
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I would prefer if we found a way to move forward with LESS or an equivalent, but ultimately that's up to UI team players
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you want to mess around and make your own version in LESS, SASS, or SCSS, might I suggest that you fork my patch. It takes 300 forevers to do this from scatch.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</description>

Replying to &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24834#comment:7" title="Comment 7"&gt;bobbingwide&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
...
I could be invoking the JavaScript multiple times with different parameters.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You're actually not invoking the JavaScript, you're loading it again and again. Passing multiple arguments to a script can be done in a more effective way from another script or number of scripts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, in order to make it unique, the handle name has to contain the query string.
...
In my experience when the value for the $handle parameter contains a query string ( such as when it matches the $src parameter, as in my example) then the API doesn't work as expected... the value of null for $ver is ignored.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;code&gt;handle&lt;/code&gt; is the internal name of the script. It supports URL query type syntax as a not recommended back-compat only. Anything passed after the &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; in a script handle is treated (and outputted) as cache busting URL query.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Btw, perhaps it's time to remove that back-compat bit from script handles. It was a back-compat even 5 years ago. Think it's a left over from before WP_Scripts supported explicit cache-busting arg.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Trying to guess what you want to do: load the same script multiple times with different query strings (quite ineffective as the script will be fully loaded each time, on top it will run multiple times that may cause unexpected results). The needed query string can be in &lt;code&gt;$src&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; in your shortcode handling function can be used to make the handle unique:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;function _my_shortcode_handler() {
  static $number = 1;
  wp_enqueue_script( 'my-script-' . $number, $src, array("jquery"), ... );
  $number++;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Suggesting closing as invalid.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #23912 (Add Composer package description) updated</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Back in &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/23912#comment:10" title="Comment 10"&gt;comment:10&lt;/a&gt;, you were advocating keeping things simple just initially here without any extra dependencies on the Composer stack, or worrying about installer paths for now. That doesn't appear to be the case anymore.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yes, which was two months and a lot of exploration ago. That is still an option of course, but it fixes WP core to the vendor directory which is considerably limiting.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I still feel like it would be a mistake adding a dependency on composer/installers right off the start
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since any Composer-driven WP project will probably need &lt;code&gt;composer/installers&lt;/code&gt; for every theme and plugin, it's not really out of line requirement.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sure, this is easy to do, and I can't currently think of a situation where it wouldn't be possible to customize, but it still results in a terrible default behavior.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don't disagree, I am just trying to lay out a all the options and come to one that would be reasonably workable both from perspective of Composer as tool and from perspective of core actually adopting it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Honestly, anything requiring a webroot should never be used as a package dependency to begin with.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I am not aiming for webroot usage, I am aiming for subdirectory install (in WP terms) / package with custom path requirement (Composer terms). Subdir install is already de-facto preferable for any serious site, since it cleanly isolates core from all the other things.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Anyway, the issues surrounding this decision are complex, which is exactly why I was agreeing with your first comment (&lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/23912#comment:10" title="Comment 10"&gt;comment:10&lt;/a&gt;) in regards to ignoring this for now, and just getting a basic composer package file in place with appropriate meta data, and appropriate PHP version dependency information.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I could live with that, but my current opinion that it will not actually move WP usage with Composer forward. It's the very start of 3.7 cycle and this was put on agenda right away, I think some time to ponder it we have.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Can we at least agree on that, and push the composer/installers dependency back to a new ticket that can be evaluated when we also have the time to investigate possible solutions to including 3rd party composer libraries through the autoloader?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If I remember right autoloaders in core are not being considered as long as 5.2 compat is the target (argument is that SPL might be disabled).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In a nutshell I am trying to provide as much information and options as I can. It's up to core team to choose which level (if any) of Composer compatibility to set as target(s).
&lt;/p&gt;

Could you provide a more detailed use case? At this point I don't see why you couldn't just unhook or overload functions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Not every theme is written to become a parent theme. That might mean that some functions are not unhookable or overloadable.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think the issue here is that this would make the child theme very fragile, and too frail for updates to the parent theme. If the parent theme isn't coded in such a way to be friendly to child themes, then maybe it shouldn't be child-themed. For this, suggest wontfix.
&lt;/p&gt;

Yes, there's still no native support for &lt;code&gt;focusin&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;focusout&lt;/code&gt; in Firefox but jQuery adds them.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
What exactly is it you are trying to accomplish here? The handle can be anything, so name it &lt;code&gt;my-example-widget-2.0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;my-example-widget-2.4&lt;/code&gt; or something. It just has special behavior when a query string is involved. If you have to generate it programmatically for some reason, replacing the ? sounds good, or try a sanitize function like &lt;code&gt;sanitize_key()&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Your patch would change current behavior. Note that &lt;code&gt;$src&lt;/code&gt; can be altered before its usage in that conditional.
&lt;/p&gt;

Replying to &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24834#comment:10" title="Comment 10"&gt;nacin&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Why are you using a uniqid() for $handle?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
See my response to &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24834#comment:8" title="Comment 8"&gt;helen&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is a case of doing it wrong.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I have to "do it wrong" in order to get it to work.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Using uniqid() ensures that each instance will get enqueued.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Would you prefer it if I coded it like this?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;// I'm not telling you how I set $src_uniq but uniqid() might be one method!
// or this may be another $src_uniq = str_replace( array( "?" ), "-", $src );
wp_register_script( $src_uniq, $src, array( "jquery"), null );
wp_enqueue_script( $src_uniq  );
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Using this technique allows me to specify the query parameters in $src AND pass a null value for $ver.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If I try to specify the query parameters in the $handle and use $ver=null then it won't work
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;wp_enqueue_script( "fladdle2?parm=ploing%2d%2D", "http://qw/bw/jq.js", array( "jquery"), null );
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
gives
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;&amp;lt;script type='text/javascript' src='http://qw/bw/jq.js?ver=parm=ploing%2d%2D'&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This is the restriction that Helen has documented.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For the record, results you may expect to get with non-null values for $ver are:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;wp_enqueue_script( "fladdle3?parm=ploing%3d%3D", "http://qw/bw/jq.js", array( "jquery"), false );
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
gives
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;&amp;lt;script type='text/javascript' src='http://qw/bw/jq.js?ver=3.7-alpha-24954&amp;amp;#038;parm=ploing%3d%3D'&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
which seems OK. Note: No conversion of %3d to %3D
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
AND
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;wp_enqueue_script( "fladdle4?parm=ploing%4d%4D", "http://qw/bw/jq.js?farm=floing%4d%4D", array( "jquery") );
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
gives
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;&amp;lt;script type='text/javascript' src='http://qw/bw/jq.js?farm=floingMM&amp;amp;#038;ver=3.7-alpha-24954&amp;amp;#038;parm=ploing%4d%4D'&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
where the query parms on the $src are parsed and re-created by add_query_arg(),
which may produce different results from expected.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
This may be a edge case, but if you have a a large number of revisions, a number of things can break.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Right now the post in question has about 1,055 revisions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Noticeably, two things are happening:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Calling wp_update_post from a plugin fails with the following error:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;PHP Fatal error:  Allowed memory size of 41943040 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 16384 bytes) in /path/wp-includes/wp-db.php on line 1228&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Using the new revisions API to view earlier revisions returns
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
"Sorry, something went wrong. The requested comparison could not be loaded."
and the error log contains the same memory exhaustion error.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I can seem to update from the post edit screen.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is happening with the latest stable of 3.6 and only began happening after an update, so I suspect it's something in the new revision core/api. I haven't had a huge amount of time to investigate but my guess is it's trying to load too much revision data at one time? Maybe it should only try to load X amount of revisions at once?
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Back in &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/23912#comment:10" title="Comment 10"&gt;comment:10&lt;/a&gt;, you were advocating keeping things simple just initially here without any extra dependencies on the Composer stack, or worrying about installer paths for now. That doesn't appear to be the case anymore.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I still feel like it would be a mistake adding a dependency on composer/installers right off the start, as well as abusing the "wordpress-plugin" type for a package it was not designed to be used for.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Using the "wordpress-plugin" type for core itself would end up requiring developers and admins using the package as a dependency to absolutely specify an installation path (even if it's fine in the default vendor path) since otherwise, it will be treated like a plugin and installed in "wp-content/plugins". Sure, this is easy to do, and I can't currently think of a situation where it wouldn't be possible to customize, but it still results in a terrible default behavior.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Honestly, anything requiring a webroot should never be used as a package dependency to begin with. It's always your base software you're installing, and as your Composer project root, it will always be in the root path of your specified installation directory (either manually installed there, or by using "composer create-project" in most situations). Defining a composer/installers "type" certainly isn't going to effect that at all, but it would download and install composer/installers even if it's not in use, and placing it within your webroot every time. Of course, if you're using this with plugins (and if you're using Composer, chances are pretty good that you are), it will require composer/installers anyway until WordPress supports traditional Composer packages itself (not just 3rd party libraries but also plugins), so probably no harm in either case. However, why make that decision in the base package? Hopefully at some point in the future, composer/installers is never required even for plugins and themes. The composer/installers package is only designed to be a transitional package, not for the purpose of building new architecture intentionally designed to be a crutch for all future use.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Anyway, the issues surrounding this decision are complex, which is exactly why I was agreeing with your first comment (&lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/23912#comment:10" title="Comment 10"&gt;comment:10&lt;/a&gt;) in regards to ignoring this for now, and just getting a basic composer package file in place with appropriate meta data, and appropriate PHP version dependency information. Can we at least agree on that, and push the composer/installers dependency back to a new ticket that can be evaluated when we also have the time to investigate possible solutions to including 3rd party composer libraries through the autoloader? We have to handle that eventually too, and it has some relevance to the composer/installers approach.
&lt;/p&gt;

I have put together small plugin that shows switching between compiled CSS and browser-compiled LESS mode &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://bitbucket.org/Rarst/less-colors"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://bitbucket.org/Rarst/less-colors&lt;/a&gt; Doesn't actually use any LESS features on top of compilation, it's too monday to rewrite 2k lines of CSS :) Symlink admin images into plugin folder for them to work.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
PS remembered that less.js is Apache License 2.0 so including it in core is toast :(

Essentially &lt;code&gt;wp_publish_post()&lt;/code&gt; is updating, so the third arg would be &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;.

Looks like Search Hilite hasn't been updated since 2005 -- so it's not too much of a surprise that it's causing issues with more recent releases. Glad you were able to sort out the problem!

      <description>&lt;i&gt;Keywords&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This scenario is one of the things that a theme setting the &lt;code&gt;$content_width&lt;/code&gt; global guards against. The Visual Editor is a what-you-see-is-close-to-what-you-get viewport, so if your theme hasn't set &lt;code&gt;$content_width&lt;/code&gt;, you'll get the true 100% width image.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So for example, in Twenty Thirteen, the &lt;code&gt;$content_width&lt;/code&gt; is set to 604px. If I drop an image with 100% width into the editor, it's 100% width of a 604px container. This is a theme issue, suggest close.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Ugh. I know Step 1 of any debugging is to turn of plugins. And I did go through trying to turn off plugins that made sense - WP Super Cache, for example. Poking around in the page source I saw:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Mannually adding the code:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;div style="width: 604px; max-width: 100%;"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;!--[if lt IE 9]&amp;gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;document.createElement('video');&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&amp;lt; ![endif]--&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-6988-1" width="604" height="340" preload="metadata" controls="controls"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;source type="video/webm" src="http://server.ericsbinaryworld.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Nothing-to-Prove-Geek-Girls-The-Doubleclicks-s4Rjy5yW1gQ.webm" /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href="http://server.ericsbinaryworld.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Nothing-to-Prove-Geek-Girls-The-Doubleclicks-s4Rjy5yW1gQ.webm"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class="hilite"&amp;gt;http://server&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;span class="hilite"&amp;gt;ericsbinaryworld&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Nothing-to-Prove-Geek-Girls-The-Doubleclicks-s4Rjy5yW1gQ.webm&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/video&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Note the span class hilite part. That made me think of a plugin I have called Search Hilite. It is from Matt Mullenweg and appears to be a Wordpress official plugin. But disabling it appears to have fixed the issue.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What should I do going forward? Is that still an active plugin or is it left over from rounds upon rounds of upgrades? Do I file a bug against that plugin?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;note: since things are working now, I removed that page from my site&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Here's an odd thing to add into the ticket - if I am logged out, it works, but if I'm logged in it doesn't. Except when that decides not to work. Looking at the source for the page - it appears to be missing all of this:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;					&amp;lt;div class="entry-content"&amp;gt;
						&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This should be audio file 1:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;!--[if lt IE 9]&amp;gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;document.createElement('audio');&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&amp;lt;![endif]--&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;audio class="wp-audio-shortcode" id="audio-6988-1" preload="none" style="width: 100%" controls="controls"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;source type="audio/mpeg" src="http://server.ericsbinaryworld.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Jonathan-Coulton-ThePrincessWhoSavedHerself.mp3" /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href="http://server.ericsbinaryworld.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Jonathan-Coulton-ThePrincessWhoSavedHerself.mp3"&amp;gt;http://server.ericsbinaryworld.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Jonathan-Coulton-ThePrincessWhoSavedHerself.mp3&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/audio&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;this should be video file 1:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;div style="width: 604px; max-width: 100%;"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;!--[if lt IE 9]&amp;gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;document.createElement('video');&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&amp;lt;![endif]--&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;this should be audio file 2:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;audio class="wp-audio-shortcode" id="audio-6988-2" preload="none" style="width: 100%" controls="controls"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;source type="audio/mpeg" src="http://server.ericsbinaryworld.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Jonathan-Coulton-ThePrincessWhoSavedHerself.mp3" /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href="http://server.ericsbinaryworld.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Jonathan-Coulton-ThePrincessWhoSavedHerself.mp3"&amp;gt;http://server.ericsbinaryworld.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Jonathan-Coulton-ThePrincessWhoSavedHerself.mp3&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/audio&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;should be video file 2:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;div style="width: 604px; max-width: 100%;"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-6988-2" width="604" height="340" preload="metadata" controls="controls"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;source type="video/mp4" src="http://server.ericsbinaryworld.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/TheDailyShow-DifferencesBetweenLatinos-small-h264.mp4" /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href="http://server.ericsbinaryworld.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/TheDailyShow-DifferencesBetweenLatinos-small-h264.mp4"&amp;gt;http://server.ericsbinaryworld.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/TheDailyShow-DifferencesBetweenLatinos-small-h264.mp4&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/video&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
											&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;!-- .entry-content --&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
There are several plugins that offer this functionality.
Examples:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-approve-user/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-approve-user/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/new-user-approve/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://wordpress.org/plugins/new-user-approve/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/multisite-user-registration-manager/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://wordpress.org/plugins/multisite-user-registration-manager/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If this were to be added to core I would suggest some other form of flag and adding the user as the default role. Then the flag could be run against the user permissions checking instead of creating an additional role. Creating an extra role would likely break the setting for the default role to add users @
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;Settings &amp;gt; General &amp;gt; New User Default Role
&lt;/pre&gt;</description>

That seems to go against the "distraction free" part of DFW. Standard keyboard shortcuts are available.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
This is cool but I am not sure that we should to turn a dead-simple filter into a fully fledged API that adds no new functionality. Contact methods are nothing more than usermeta. I think all that is missing is just a public function for fetching registered contact methods.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Images of size 100% (default) are displayed in its full size in the editor. If I upload an large image, I would have to scroll a long distance to reach the contents after the image, this is a little annoying to me.
And I think there is little chance of the author wanting to show the image in its full size, most author just wants it to fit the content column width.
Images are shrinked to fit the content column in most themes even if the image size is set to 100%, so there is little reason to show images in full size in the editor.
Therefore I suggest that Wordpress shrink images to fit the editor column width if the image width exceeds it.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Why are you using a uniqid() for $handle? Use a real string like 'my-example-widget' or something.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I doubt many people are using this "special" logic — and it likely just predates extra arguments like $ver and such. I'd have to look. But we're not going to remove it. Proper handle names are required. This is a case of doing it wrong.
&lt;/p&gt;

It's not working for me here at work (Firefox 19). (When I made the ticket I was at home) I have attached an image. If I try it in IE (instead of FF) I get a bunch of js errors. Let me know if there's something I can do in FF (dev console or something) that would help me to provide you with diagnostics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thanks.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Some more information... I'll try to answer my own questions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In my experience when the value for the $handle parameter contains a query string ( such as when it matches the $src parameter, as in my example) then the API doesn't work as expected... the value of null for $ver is ignored.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The patch I provided works for 3.5.2, 3.6 and 3.7-alpha-24954. But it may cause the special case logic to fail. The special case logic is documented in the codex as:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As a special case, if the string contains a '?' character, the preceding part of the string refers to the registered handle, and the succeeding part is appended to the URL as a query string.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start="2"&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a workaround I have changed my code to use the PHP uniqid() function to provide the $handle
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;$src = "http://www.example.com/widget.js?token=something%3d%3d";
wp_enqueue_script( uniqid(), $src, array( "jquery"), null );
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Perhaps THIS should be documented in the codex? I wonder how many people are making use of the special case logic.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
If one could use wp_enqueue_style to set the "rel" attribute, it would make using Less.js(&lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://lesscss.org/#usage"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://lesscss.org/#usage&lt;/a&gt;) a lot easier in WordPress. And would reduce the need for core function filtering (&lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/20876/less-css-enqueue-style-with-add-filter-to-change-rel-attribute"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/20876/less-css-enqueue-style-with-add-filter-to-change-rel-attribute&lt;/a&gt;) which, as a novice coder, scares me as it's one more hack I have to remember.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'm not sure if that's a core enhancement, but Less.js does seem pretty popular. Even more so now that Bootstrap 3(&lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#download-cdn"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#download-cdn&lt;/a&gt;) is pushing it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I hope this is useful.
&lt;/p&gt;

@Pauldewouters. Please try again because I can reproduce the problem very easily using the oik base plugin (v2.1-alpha.0802) AND the following shortcode
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;[bw_jq src="http://www.example.com/widget.js?token=somethingcomplicated%3d%3d"]

right, I didn't notice the handle was dynamic too

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
@helen There should be no need to give it a proper handle name if you apply the fix.
I could be invoking the JavaScript multiple times with different parameters.
So, in order to make it unique, the handle name has to contain the query string.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I know weird things happen. My patch is a pragmatic solution to the problem.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Sometimes needed to completely disable or full rewriting the file functions.php parent theme. But this is impossible. Renaming or deleting pointless after updating themes all come back.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I believe that we can introduce a constant defined in the file functions.php child theme, which will properly disable functions.php parent theme.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Example:
wp-content/themes/theme-child/functions.php
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;&amp;lt;?php
define( 'CHILD_THEME_ONLY', true );
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
And little changes in wp-setting.php:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;if ( ! defined( 'WP_INSTALLING' ) || 'wp-activate.php' === $pagenow ) {
	if ( TEMPLATEPATH !== STYLESHEETPATH &amp;amp;&amp;amp; file_exists( STYLESHEETPATH . '/functions.php' ) )
		include( STYLESHEETPATH . '/functions.php' );
	if ( ! defined('CHILD_THEME_ONLY') ) {
		if ( file_exists( TEMPLATEPATH . '/functions.php' ) )
			include( TEMPLATEPATH . '/functions.php' );
	}
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Sorry for my English and posting code here. I don't know how to create patches.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I think the main advantage of using one of these bad boys is the ability to break apart the 10 billion line CSS files into modules / imports. It has been a huge upgrade to every huge project I have worked on. I may do a LESS proof of concept today to show my worldview.
&lt;/p&gt;

Also, &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://gist.github.com/chriseppstein/674726"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;comparison of SCSS and Less&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6159050"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt;) that might help with a decision on a specific one. Personally, I prefer SCSS's mixin syntax, which makes clear the distinction between virtual classes (mixins) and real ones, whereas Less only has real classes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Also, interesting note: "Sass output compression currently beats the google pagespeed css plugin output by a few percent."
&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24952/1375693780647630</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
WordPress has a very nifty filter called &lt;strong&gt;user_contactmethods&lt;/strong&gt; that allows us to add user contact methods to the profile screen in the dashboard. We can add and remove contact methods using this code:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;function custom_user_contact_methods( $user_contactmethods ){
	// Remove contact methods
	unset($user_contactmethods['yim']);
	unset($user_contactmethods['aim']);
	unset($user_contactmethods['jabber']);
	// Add new contact methods
	$user_contactmethods['facebook'] = 'Facebook Username';
	$user_contactmethods['twitter']  = 'Twitter Username';
	return $user_contactmethods;
}
add_filter( 'user_contactmethods', 'custom_user_contact_methods' );
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But i want to make it even easier and provide developers more tools to controll the user profile page. I think we need to create the new "&lt;strong&gt;User-Profile Contact-Methods API&lt;/strong&gt;".
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The general idea is to provide a set of functions:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;register_user_contact_method();
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;usregister_user_contact_method();
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;user_contact_method_exists();
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;has_user_contact_method()
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;...
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;...
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;...
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Something like that:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;// Unregister contact methods
$old_methods = array( 'yim', 'aim', 'jabber' );
unregister_user_contact_method( $old_methods ),
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;// Register contact methods
$new_methods = array(
	'facebook' =&amp;gt; __( 'Facebook User Name', 'GenerateWP' ),
	'twitter'  =&amp;gt; __( 'Twitter User Name',  'GenerateWP' ),
);
register_user_contact_method( $new_methods );
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;// Check if contact method exist
if ( user_contact_method_exists( 'skype' ) ) {
	// Do somthing
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;// Check if the user has contact method (not empty)
if ( has_user_contact_method( 'skype' ) ) {
	// Do somthing
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This way plugin authors will have better API to develop more complex tools within the dashboard.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is the basic concept. Would like to hear your thoughts about this idea.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Quick editing adds the "alternate" class to the table row, even if it didn't have that class before. This only happens after updating, not after cancelling. Causes grey table rows to turn white in the current style and white rows to turn grey in mp6.

I just noticed that the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;mark&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag is not allowed for administrators in WPMU 3.6. All other tags like: b, i, em, strong, sup, sub, samp, var, kbd, s, small, q, ins, dfn, del, cite, abbr, a seem to be allowed. I imported an XML using [Tools &amp;gt; Import] and it was stripped.

In the Danish language the characters are always transcribed as follows:
Æ -&amp;gt; ae
Ø -&amp;gt; oe
Å -&amp;gt; aa
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Google and Bing recognize these transcriptions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Decided to not convert the entire codebase, but &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://gist.github.com/rmccue/6153630"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;just a few for now&lt;/a&gt;. This isn't really using all the strengths of a preprocessor (that is, sharing across files), but I haven't had time to get to that yet.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This generates &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://gist.github.com/rmccue/6153632"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;almost the exact same CSS&lt;/a&gt;, but with some changes. I've left the line number comments in for now; when importing this into WP, we'd move the actual compilation tasks off to bumpbot with the style set to compressed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Keep in mind that converting the codebase isn't a small task that I have time to handle, but if you'd like to see a more practical usage, I can open-source a slightly larger codebase of mine that uses SCSS extensively.
&lt;/p&gt;

I'm working on a conversion of MP6 to SCSS at the moment as a proof of concept. :) (I'm also using the &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://compass-style.org/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;Compass framework&lt;/a&gt; at the moment for utility mixins, but I'm happy to rewrite it without the framework.)

      <pubDate>Mon, 05 Aug 2013 04:18:24 GMT</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I thought this was cahe-related at first because of how weird it is, but I tried different browsers and both Windows and Linux computer. I created a post at:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://server.ericsbinaryworld.com/blog/video-embed-test/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://server.ericsbinaryworld.com/blog/video-embed-test/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It should be showing two videos and two audio files.  Here's what's in the post:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;
This should be audio file 1:
[audio mp3="http://server.ericsbinaryworld.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Jonathan-Coulton-ThePrincessWhoSavedHerself.mp3"][/audio]
this should be video file 1:
[video width="1280" height="720" webm="http://server.ericsbinaryworld.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Nothing-to-Prove-Geek-Girls-The-Doubleclicks-s4Rjy5yW1gQ.webm"][/video]
this should be audio file 2:
[audio mp3="http://server.ericsbinaryworld.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Jonathan-Coulton-ThePrincessWhoSavedHerself.mp3"][/audio]
should be video file 2:
[video width="1280" height="720" mp4="http://server.ericsbinaryworld.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/TheDailyShow-DifferencesBetweenLatinos-small-h264.mp4"][/video]
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
However, the area where the embeds should be is blank. When I first created the past I put one audio embed and it worked. Then I put the video embed and both of them stopped working. Then I added the second audio embed and it worked again. Added the second video embed and it stopped working. But here's the nutty thing that made me escalate from a support forum to a trac but - you'd think that if I then removed the second embedded video, it would work again. But no. Now nothing I do related to embeds works. Also tried turning WP Super Cache on and off and deleting cached files. Doesn't seem to affect it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And I have another post where I wanted to embed the second file and it won't show up there either.
&lt;/p&gt;

Weird things happen if you have a query string in the handle. You can chase the whys like I did for a little while, or just give it a proper handle name, like &lt;code&gt;example-widget&lt;/code&gt; or something. :)
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Related: &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21150" title="#21150: defect (bug): Add a way to prevent a term from being deleted (closed: invalid)"&gt;#21150&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Indeed, unlike &lt;code&gt;WP_Terms_List_Table::column_name()&lt;/code&gt;, which checks &lt;code&gt;'default_' . $taxonomy&lt;/code&gt; option (&lt;a class="source" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/3.6/wp-admin/includes/class-wp-terms-list-table.php#L246"&gt;tags/3.6/wp-admin/includes/class-wp-terms-list-table.php#L246&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/export/HEAD/tags/3.6/wp-admin/includes/class-wp-terms-list-table.php#L246" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;code&gt;wp_delete_term()&lt;/code&gt; only checks &lt;code&gt;'default_category'&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;a class="changeset" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/15690" title="Have wp_delete_category wrap wp_delete_term. Move wp_delete_category ..."&gt;[15690]&lt;/a&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The patch would make it consistent. Please use tabs rather than spaces for indentation though (per &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/coding-standards/php/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;WordPress Coding Standards&lt;/a&gt;).

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
When we create a custom taxonomy with default term, it can be deletable by wp_delete_term() because it controls only category`s default term to prevent delete. I think wp_delete_term() should control all taxonomy default terms, or at least there should be a pre_delete_taxonomy hook to stop the deletion.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
...ed.onMouseUp.add is never fired (in FF).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That's strange. There are very few differences between TinyMCE in 3.5 and 3.6, and &lt;code&gt;ed.onMouseUp.add()&lt;/code&gt; seems to work properly when calling it from any TinyMCE plugin. Perhaps delete the browser cache again, then add some basic console.log() to make sure the whole plugin is not crashing (TinyMCE silences errors in plugins).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In any case you can disable image resizing in Firefox with &lt;code&gt;'object_resizing' =&amp;gt; false&lt;/code&gt;, there's no need of a plugin.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

But now I realized why there were different strings. "Not found" was probably shorter version to better fit into 404.php template. Sorry, maybe revert for 3.7?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Indeed, "Not Found" looks better in the 404 template: &lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/24891/24891.404-not-found.png" title="Attachment '24891.404-not-found.png' in Ticket #24891"&gt;24891.404-not-found.png&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/24891/24891.404-not-found.png" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt; vs. &lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/24891/24891.404-nothing-found.png" title="Attachment '24891.404-nothing-found.png' in Ticket #24891"&gt;24891.404-nothing-found.png&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/24891/24891.404-nothing-found.png" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
"Nothing Found", on the other hand, is also displayed when nothing is found in a search: &lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/24891/24891.nothing-found.png" title="Attachment '24891.nothing-found.png' in Ticket #24891"&gt;24891.nothing-found.png&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/24891/24891.nothing-found.png" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt;, and it's probably better than "Not Found" there.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So a revert makes sense to me.
&lt;/p&gt;

Maybe this could even be added as a feature of MP6, which is probably a good place to look since its already in its own sandbox.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I would agree that MP6 or even a companion plugin is likely a better route for experimenting, given that CSS patches to core have a nasty habit of going stale quickly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Also... let's not rabbit hole (yet). One step at a time, and the first step in my eyes is converting some existing file and demonstrating/describing a contributor's workflow to making a patch for the admin. I would also still like to see both SASS and LESS represented :) That is to say: data is nice.
&lt;/p&gt;

I am not sure why OP has such an issue with LESS syntax, since valid CSS is valid LESS. LESS is historically close to common CSS syntax, while SASS moved towards it from more diverged version.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For my taste LESS is preferable because it can be run with less.js in browser, which is not very performant but trivial to set up.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I personally don't care as long as we decide to move forward with at least experimenting and trying to do something to make the styling easier to tap into without completely overriding it with custom CSS. Maybe this could even be added as a feature of MP6, which is probably a good place to look since its already in its own sandbox.
&lt;/p&gt;

Important for me is, that we not only discuss about the preprocessor for administration. The topic is often a requirement of different topics on front and backend and important, if you will, that more and more developrs work with wp and can use his default tools.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #23912 (Add Composer package description) updated</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Draft updated with &lt;code&gt;wordpress-plugin&lt;/code&gt; type (path of least resistance):
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;{
	"name"       : "wordpress/wordpress",
	"description": "WordPress is web software you can use to create a beautiful website or blog.",
	"keywords"   : ["blog", "cms"],
	"homepage"   : "http://wordpress.org/",
	"license"    : "GPL-2.0+",
	"authors"    : [
		{
			"name"    : "WordPress Community",
			"homepage": "http://wordpress.org/about/"
		}
	],
	"support"    : {
		"issues": "http://core.trac.wordpress.org/",
		"forum" : "http://wordpress.org/support/",
		"wiki"  : "http://codex.wordpress.org/",
		"irc"   : "irc://irc.freenode.net/wordpress",
		"source": "http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser"
	},
	"type"       : "wordpress-plugin",
	"require"    : {
		"php"                : "&amp;gt;=5.2.4",
		"composer/installers": "~1.0"
	}
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Then root package, requiring WordPress, would need to specify path for it in its &lt;code&gt;composer.json&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;"require"     : {
        "wordpress/wordpress"          : "&amp;gt;=3.6",
    },
"extra"       : {
        "installer-paths": {
            "./wp/": ["wordpress/wordpress"]
        }
    }
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Also this probably drags de-facto requirement for Composer use to PHP 5.3+, but I can't imagine it being relevant since Composer itself requires 5.3 to work and earlier versions in requirements are used more informatively for non-Composer use, than practically.
&lt;/p&gt;

Hi azaozz,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
thank you for the fast answer. My code, depending on &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://code.google.com/p/tinymce-plugin-advimagescale/source/browse/trunk/editor_plugin_src.js"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://code.google.com/p/tinymce-plugin-advimagescale/source/browse/trunk/editor_plugin_src.js&lt;/a&gt; worked very well until I updated to verison 3.6.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I already added a console.log and figured out that ed.onMouseUp.add is never fired (in FF).
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;i&gt;Keywords&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Image resizing works differently in the different browsers in contenteditable mode:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;WebKit and Opera don't resize images at all. TinyMCE can add it but is turned off by default in WordPress.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Firefox has built-in resizing that can be turned off by adding &lt;code&gt;'object_resizing' =&amp;gt; false,&lt;/code&gt; to the TinyMCE init options. Note: this will also turn off resizing of tables.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;IE has built-in resizing that cannot be turned off.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The built-in resizing in IE and Firefox is not controllable from JS. What events are fired and when depends on the browsers. I see 'ed.onMouseUp' fired in both IE and FIrefox but with different target elements depending on which direction the user is resizing the image. Perhaps try this in your plugin:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;ed.onMouseUp.add( function( editor, event ) {
    console.log( event.target.nodeName );
});
&lt;/pre&gt;</description>

Hi rickykalsi,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In developing a theme that uses the new audio in WP, I ran into significant issues with iOS controls. It turned out that the issue was related to some server configs that were neither mediaelement.js or WordPress core related.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Can you expand on the issue? I would interested to see if you hit a problem similar to mine. I do have concerns that there could be a number of bugs that spring up across different server environments given how touchy HTML5 audio can be. Do you happen to have your test install publicly available? I would love to take a look at it if so.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
This would also enable performance analytics, such as seeing for slow page loads, which get_template_part() calls happen to suck the most time, and potentially providing a system to toggle caching of them in the Admin UI.
&lt;/p&gt;

Hi Dominik,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I have reported this to media elements. I was surprised that this was not picked up in any UAT testing prior to the 3.6 launch.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you install the media element JS plugin the audio player works fine (volume slider and mute butons are removed - which is correct )
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Can you filter which class is used now? Overloading the class by extending it would be handy still.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The main problem for me was quick edit. If the issues there are solved with post meta then by all means close the ticket.
&lt;/p&gt;

This ticket is about storing registered post types and statuses persistently in the database, rather than registering them at runtime. It's not about the functionality in general.

The login always worked till I updated yesterday to 3.6
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We have a programmed a special registration page and insert the user directly in the database.

Technically not a bug or a defect, perfectly acceptable in it's given state.  Could easily break and add developer anguish if someone starts adding styles.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Updated the patch just a bit. wp_dropdown_pages() now tosses out the filtered post_status and reverts to 'publish' on the Reading Settings page, preventing admins from doing something unwise there.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I have not yet incorporated mbijon's suggestions for password-protected pages. That'll be my next step. If anyone has time to try out the current patch with draft and private pages, I'd appreciate feedback on the general direction of things.
&lt;/p&gt;

Force children of unpublished parent pages to inherit status. Includes new argument filters for wp_list_pages() and wp_dropdown_pages().
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;i&gt;Summary&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I've been working on trunk all day, and the problem is still there: shift-click selection works downward, but not upward. I have no plugins installed that might interfere with the JS.
&lt;/p&gt;
