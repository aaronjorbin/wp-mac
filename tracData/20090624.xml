Had a thought earlier today. FWIW, WP and WPMU seem slated to merge into a single code-base. So we're probably kicking a dead horse. Best I'm aware, terms and users are already shared across blogs. This would merely leave merging post_meta and a yet to be done comment_meta.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #10264 (use instanceof instead of is_a()) created</title>
      
        <dc:creator>Mittineague</dc:creator>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
My Error Reporting plugin broke with 2.8 in part because of an extreme number of errors (mostly simplepie "non-static called staticly" errors).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But there is also a problem with errors in Core files i.e. is_a()
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
True they are only E_STRICT deprecated errors and is_a() is un-deprecated in PHP 5.3.0 and it may be more trouble than it's worth to handle the differences for PHP &amp;lt; 5.0, PHP 5.0, PHP 5.1+
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I have PHP 5.2.6 so I didn't need the "fatal error" work-around, but I made changes similar to
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;//	if ( !is_a($wp_scripts, 'WP_Scripts') )
	$wp_scripts_string = 'WP_Scripts';
	if ( !($wp_scripts instanceof $wp_scripts_string) )
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
in the following wp-includes files
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;wp-includes/class-feed.php [1 fix]
wp-includes/class-IXR.php [5 fixes]
wp-includes/classes.php [1 fix]
wp-includes/functions.wp-scripts.php [6 fixes]
wp-includes/functions.wp-styles.php [5 fixes]
wp-includes/general-template.php [1 fix]
wp-includes/script-loader.php [4 fixes]
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Of particular note is the classes.php file which literally throws hundreds of errors per page on my blog.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;function is_wp_error($thing) {
//	if ( is_object($thing) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; is_a($thing, 'WP_Error') )
	$wp_error_string = 'WP_Error';
	if ( is_object($thing) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; ($thing instanceof $wp_error_string) )
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
And I may be off, but the functions.wp-styles.php file has a function that looks suspicious
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;function wp_style_is( $handle, $list = 'queue' ) {
.....
//	if ( !is_a($wp_styles, 'WP_Scripts') )
	$wp_scripts_string = 'WP_Scripts';
	if ( !($wp_styles instanceof $wp_scripts_string) )
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
i.e. if $wp_styles is not a WP_Scripts it becomes a WP_Styles
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I think the real underlying issue is we need abstraction in the php. It's like, if the data cannot go into wp_posts (which could really be called wp_nodes),
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
How very Drupalish of you. (I came to WordPress by way of Drupal. :)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
and ends up requiring a separate table, I'd personally suggest it should get its own meta table as well. So long as the needed php functions are around to manage this user-defined meta table, things should be fine.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think that is grand in concept and certainly follows the relational model but I think in practice following said rules results in increases in rigidity and complexity without equivalent increases in benefit.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Certainly for the most prominent data elements it makes sense to have them each in their own tables but I urge you to reconsider the edge cases as they are IMO handled much better by creating a repository to hold them all instead of requiring "yet another table" for what are often edge cases.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I know... I've been playing around with the idea of a nodes table for over 10 years.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Not to one-up you (well, okay maybe I am) I've been playing with them for 20 years... :) And for the most I've decided the complexity is not worth the pain.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We could actually do this by switching to UUID types instead of auto-incremented integers. It adds an extra benefit along the way, too: you can then sync sites that use shared databases.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
UUID have a certain elegance but if you are concerned about performance as you were regarding "vtypes" then UUIDs have a whole series of issues:
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2007/03/13/to-uuid-or-not-to-uuid/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2007/03/13/to-uuid-or-not-to-uuid/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Might it be that you only ever needed to write queries that involved one or two joins?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
LOL!!!!!  Sorry, I've at times written queries that exceeded the number of tables that the then SQL Server parser could handle (max 32 tables.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I've built some very complex database systems. I built a full ecommerce platform starting in 1995 for internal use that processed almost $100 million in revenue for my company over a 10 year period. I can promise you that almost everything I did had more than two joins.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And I've had to do a lot of work with tables in Drupal too. For example, here's a query I pulled from a project of mine (not exactly trivial):
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;SELECT
	vehicle.nid,
	vehicle.title,
	vehicle_content.teaser,
	vehicle_path.dst AS path,
	IFNULL(caption.field_photo_caption_value,image_node.title) AS photo_caption,
	files.filepath AS photo_file,
	IFNULL(photo_info.field_image_orientation_value,'landscape') AS photo_orientation
FROM
	node showcase
	INNER JOIN content_field_vehicle cfv ON showcase.nid=cfv.nid
	INNER JOIN node vehicle ON cfv.field_vehicle_nid=vehicle.nid
	INNER JOIN content_type_vehicle ctv ON vehicle.nid=ctv.nid
	INNER JOIN node_revisions vehicle_content ON vehicle.nid=vehicle_content.nid AND vehicle.vid=vehicle_content.vid
	INNER JOIN url_alias vehicle_path ON vehicle_path.src=CONCAT('node/',vehicle.nid)
	LEFT OUTER JOIN content_field_photo_caption caption ON vehicle.nid=caption.nid
	LEFT OUTER JOIN image_attach ia ON vehicle.nid=ia.nid
	LEFT OUTER JOIN node image_node ON ia.iid=image_node.nid
	LEFT OUTER JOIN content_type_image photo_info ON photo_info.nid=image_node.nid
	LEFT OUTER JOIN files ON image_node.nid=files.nid
WHERE
	showcase.type='showcase' AND
	vehicle.type='vehicle' AND
	ctv.field_vehicle_subtype_value in ('abstract','standalone') AND
	(files.fid IS NULL OR COALESCE(files.filename,'small')='%s') AND
	showcase.nid=%d AND
	vehicle.status=1
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I ask, because my own 10 years of experience tell me a rather different story. I was a varchar index junkie until 2-3 years ago -- until I ended up needing to look into the performance of an app that was heavy on joins and that had more than a minute amount of data.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Funny how the pendulum swings one way and then the next. It is likely our cycles are just not in sync.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
PGSQL ended up using merge join plans (= the slowest you can get) that involved zillions of rows. No amount of vacuum analyze, adding partial indexes, or clustering the data helped in any meaningful way. Re-engineering the DB in such a way that PG had means to fetch the needed rows using less joins, on integer/uuid fields only, bought the app was brought back to life.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
No debate there.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My own bottom line was this: primary key (object_id, object_type) = avoid like the Plague if you've a large amount of data.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What's large?  1000?  Or 100 million?  I'll give you the latter, not the former.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For performance on large data sets, integer keys are the best. String are much slower, and the string the larger the indexes get and the more page loads from disk are required to seek into the index. But that's doesn't mean all indexes MUST be integers as I'll explain below.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Also I'm not a fan of composite keys in general, but I've also come to believe that every rule has reasonable exceptions. You can get around the composite key issue by concatonating (i.e. "273links_meta") but that's not elegant unless it can be done on a trigger.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
OTOH, one of the biggest evils I have found in technology is premature optimization. To enforce a prohibition on composite indexes of (int,string) "at all costs" is a premature optimization for tables that may 99.9% of the time have less than 100,000 records. That's why I am suggesting them for use in edge cases. IF we find that one of those objects starts getting hundreds of thousands of records and many installations THEN it is time to optimize. But don't force all the complexity on the edge cases simple because there is a tiny chance on of them might become a non-edge case.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In case you're thinking WP will never get so much data that this will make a big difference, consider the zillions of blogs, users, posts, terms, links, and comments on wordpress.com.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'm not at all assuming WP won't get that much data. I am instead assuming that not all data in WP will get so big that performance optimization concerns actually matter.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Look at it this way; if you don't give plugin and theme developers an appropriate place to store data they will instead store their data in far less appropriate places (i.e. an overloaded wp_options table, for example) and they will see far worse performance than the purity of your approach wants to ensure against. Remember that most people who use and program for WordPress do know have any experience with SQL and are even afraid of it so they won't be creating custom tables on their own, they will be overloading wp_options.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As a case in point: Nathan Rice. Nathan is a brillant theme developer but has said he doesn't understand database and won't go near SQL even though I know if he did he's easily smart enough to learn it in no time. There are *many* Nathans out that and you need to give them a tool they are comfortable using instead of giving them prohibition for fear that one day by some small chance they might misuse that tool.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I can see the thinking behind this suggestion, but inputting post passwords and logging into the admin area are two exclusive actions and the setting for one shouldn't have an affect on the other. The administration over SSL settings are for administration after all, not for visitors using the front end.
&lt;/p&gt;

Did you simulate any error conditions?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yes, two:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Made the uploads directory unwritable
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;got rid of PHP's tmp directory
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I was using only the browser uploader for my tests, however. I think that the browser uploader would fail to print messages more often than the Flash / Ajax uploader, because of the redirection issue.
&lt;/p&gt;

`foo_bar_foo` (with backticks) prevents the italics and encloses the string in &amp;lt;code&amp;gt; tags.  Is that good enough?  Where do you use underscores outside of snips (even one word snips) of code?

Instead of applying the 'intermediate_image_sizes' filter all over the place, there should be a single function that returns the filtered sizes.

This patch should fix it for the Tags screens but needs some testing. It uses some of the new methods in jQuery 1.3 and doesn't need wp-lists and the jQuery forms plugin.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If all is working well will add it on the categories and link categories screens too.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #10262 (Plugin editor fails without PHP tokenizer support) created</title>
      
        <dc:creator>EasyTarget</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Wed, 24 Jun 2009 13:28:36 GMT</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
When trying to edit a plugin on my Wordpress following the 2.8 upgrade (from 2.7.1) the edit screen was blank. The header and admin sidebar remained, but the rest of the edit plugin page was entirely blank. In my logs I saw the following every time I selected 'edit' in the plugins menu:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
[24-Jun-2009 14:22:38] PHP Fatal error:  Call to undefined function token_get_all() in /usr/local/www/wordpress/wordpress/wp-admin/includes/misc.php on line 273
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Only the plugin editor appeared affected.. the theme editor (which I assume is very similar code-wise) appeared to work correctly. Removing all plugins except 'hello dolly' failed to resolve this.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I have another WP install at work, also upgraded to 2.8 at the same time, and the plugin editor on that install works correctly. The failing system is my personal FreeBSD7.2 server, the working one being a Debian (Etch) system. Both fully updated.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Googling around I found the following thread on the WP forums:
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/277659"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://wordpress.org/support/topic/277659&lt;/a&gt;
which lead on to:
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://wordpress.org/tags/token_get_all"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://wordpress.org/tags/token_get_all&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On my personal system I did:
# cd /usr/ports/devel/php5-tokenizer/ &amp;amp;&amp;amp; make install clean &amp;amp;&amp;amp; apachectl restart
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ie. install PHP tokenizer and restarts apache.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The plugin editor immediately started working correctly on my Wordpress.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, it looks like php-tokenizer has become a requirement for Wordpress ;-)
or.. the plugin editor needs to be reworked to remove it's dependence on the tokenizer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As the above threads note; tokenizer support is not always available/enabled for hosted PHP solutions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ideally the reliance on this should be removed.
Or (if it is actually 'a good thing(tm)') tokenizer support should be added to the WP requirements list so that affected end-users have some ammunition if their hosting provider asks 'why' they should enable it.
&lt;/p&gt;

Replying to &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5183#comment:31" title="Comment 31"&gt;mikeschinkel&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When it comes to properly optimize the queries afterwards, joining posts with a table contains IDs from posts, comments, links and users won't fare as well as one on a table that contains IDs from a single one.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Agreed. My biggest concerns are making sure there is what I like to call "an escape valve"; i.e. the ability for a plugin developer to add metadata for any arbitrary object w/o having to add their own table or to overload an existing table in a non-relational manner. If the team thinks link meta should be in a specific table I'm fine with that but do want to see a table that can handle arbitrary objects.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think the real underlying issue is we need abstraction in the php. It's like, if the data cannot go into wp_posts (which could really be called wp_nodes), and ends up requiring a separate table, I'd personally suggest it should get its own meta table as well. So long as the needed php functions are around to manage this user-defined meta table, things should be fine.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now, if we introduce some kind of node ID so as to ensure no two pieces of data in posts, comments, links and users share the same numeric ID, that's a different story. Generic meta and term2node tables then makes perfect sense. But that's a much more massive change.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'd caution against a generic node ID; I think it adds too much complexity w/o enough benefits.  I also think that there is huge value to established structure and changing established structure should only happen when very significant improvements would come with it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I know... I've been playing around with the idea of a nodes table for over 10 years. We could actually do this by switching to UUID types instead of auto-incremented integers. It adds an extra benefit along the way, too: you can then sync sites that use shared databases.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Simply put: 15 years ago I was exactly certain the answers for all the rules about how database apps should be developed. Today I wonder if there really are any rules at all that don't fail in one use-case or another.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Might it be that you only ever needed to write queries that involved one or two joins? I ask, because my own 10 years of experience tell me a rather different story. I was a varchar index junkie until 2-3 years ago -- until I ended up needing to look into the performance of an app that was heavy on joins and that had more than a minute amount of data.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
PGSQL ended up using merge join plans (= the slowest you can get) that involved zillions of rows. No amount of vacuum analyze, adding partial indexes, or clustering the data helped in any meaningful way. Re-engineering the DB in such a way that PG had means to fetch the needed rows using less joins, on integer/uuid fields only, bought the app was brought back to life.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My own bottom line was this: primary key (object_id, object_type) = avoid like the Plague if you've a large amount of data. If you can ensure that object_id is unique across the various tables using a single sequence (and thus the primary key all by itself), you can abstract as much as you want (and indeed, you don't need the hard-coded referential integrity). But it *must* be unique.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In case you're thinking WP will never get so much data that this will make a big difference, consider the zillions of blogs, users, posts, terms, links, and comments on wordpress.com.
&lt;/p&gt;

Are you certain it gets saved and that this isn't merely a UI issue?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Certain, nope. It might be a UI issue - which still needs fixin' :)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Normally, as long as you don't explicitly edit and save a permalink, it'll remain blank until you publish.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I guess you mean "blank in the database".
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Maybe that is the point: If the slug is once set and then changed, saving the post should save the (changed) slug as well.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Not sure about this: some people can prefer to have a full title and only have a couple keywords as a slug - or on the contrary, have the full title+a few more keywords as a slug, for SEO reasons. Hence, slugs should not be made to automatically match the titles.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Or maybe I misunderstood you :)
&lt;/p&gt;

I think it works this way now. I have tried and it waits until I focus another place to autosave and create the permalink.

I've asked the original reporter to test the behavior of the importer from a DC2 blog. Hopefully it will show it does work then. In the meantime, let's wait.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Note: reporter initially contact the FR community, proposing his patch. I pointed him into the Trac direction. Further information from him will surely be in English.

This would be useful as an inclusion in the Dotclear importer, but note that the included file is not a patch. Remaining steps:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;remove hardcoded dependecies (ie. "/photoblog/wp-includes/images/dotclear/") ;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;turn this into a proper patch for the Dotclear importer.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

Replying to &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5183#comment:29" title="Comment 29"&gt;Denis-de-Bernardy&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are occasions where you some DB integrity is very desired. When dealing with accounting-related data, for instance: if you delete a user, you need to be sure that the query will fail if it's about to delete lines in your accounting.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Oh, agreed; right tool for the right job.  I didn't mention those use-cases because generally people don't use WordPress for accounting (though admittedly some do.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When it comes to properly optimize the queries afterwards, joining posts with a table contains IDs from posts, comments, links and users won't fare as well as one on a table that contains IDs from a single one.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Agreed. My biggest concerns are making sure there is what I like to call "an escape valve"; i.e. the ability for a plugin developer to add metadata for any arbitrary object w/o having to add their own table or to overload an existing table in a non-relational manner. If the team thinks link meta should be in a specific table I'm fine with that but do want to see a table that can handle arbitrary objects.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now, if we introduce some kind of node ID so as to ensure no two pieces of data in posts, comments, links and users share the same numeric ID, that's a different story. Generic meta and term2node tables then makes perfect sense. But that's a much more massive change.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'd caution against a generic node ID; I think it adds too much complexity w/o enough benefits.  I also think that there is huge value to established structure and changing established structure should only happen when very significant improvements would come with it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Expanding on the previous comment, the last thing want are joins that use indexes like (foo_id, vtype) or (foo_id, bar_id, vtype), where vtype is a varchar. We can use the vtype internally in php and simple queries, but at the end of the day, there needs to be a means to join tables using integers only for performance reasons.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It's ironic. I came to WordPress/MySQL via a year of Drupal/MySQL but before that 12 years of ASP/VBScript/SQL Server where we *never* used anything except numeric keys (and with constraints in the database!) My first reaction to storing strings for keys was one of disgust but after working with both Drupal then WordPress I've really come to appreciate and even prefer them.  I do understand the performance concerns but wonder if the gains for moving to all integers is really worth the loss of usability for working directly with the database which I do all the time (for development.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Simply put: 15 years ago I was exactly certain the answers for all the rules about how database apps should be developed. Today I wonder if there really are any rules at all that don't fail in one use-case or another.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;i&gt;Keywords&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Severity&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Milestone&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Adapted from French:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While importing my Dotclear blog (v1.2.7.1) intro WordPress using the included importing tool, I stumbled upon the following issue: my posts' categories where indeed imported into the WP blog, but they were not linked to the posts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Finding no help on forums, I coded a small PHP file to solve the issue. I submit it to your consideration.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Note that Dotclear is 1.2.x is an old branch of that blogging tool. It is no longer developed, and  &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://fr.dotclear.org/blog/post/2008/11/27/Dotclear-1.4"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;user support will be dropped in August 2009&lt;/a&gt; (documentation, forum, ...). The latest version for this branch is 1.2.8, which was released on &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://fr.dotclear.org/blog/post/2008/04/18/Dotclear-128"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;April 18th, 2008&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Latest and best version of Dotclear is &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://fr.dotclear.org/blog/post/2009/02/05/Dotclear-2.1.5"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;v2.1.5&lt;/a&gt;, and any change to the DC import tool should make sure not to break importing for more recent versions of DC.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Permnalinks (for a post, better call that slug) - once set - need to be manually changed then afterwards. That change is independent from pressing the posts save changes button. Maybe that is the point: If the slug is once set and then changed, saving the post should save the (changed) slug as well.
&lt;/p&gt;

J'ai développé un fichier PHP pour changer le chemin des images car dans un billet, le chemin était celui du blog dotclear après l'import dans wordpress
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I wrote a php file that changes the image links in posts after a dotclear import. The posts were imported with references to their dotclear location.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Are you certain it gets saved and that this isn't merely a UI issue? Normally, as long as you don't explicitly edit and save a permalink, it'll remain blank until you publish.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For instance, if you take the title in your other ticket, and click save draft without bothering to edit the permalink, you should see the correct permalink when the page gets refreshed. Whereas, if you edit and save the permalink as you describe, you will need to change it -- because you had set it explicitly.
&lt;/p&gt;

Bonjour,

&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;

donc
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
utilisé votre module d’import dans l’interface d’administration.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
J’ai rencontré le problème suivant :
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;         les catégories des mes billets étaient bien importées
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
mais n’étaient pas liées à ces derniers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
J’ai donc contacté votre staff par l’intermédiaire de votre site mais
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
sans succès.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

J’ai du coup développé un petit fichier php pour résoudre mon

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
As a follow-up to &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10256" title="#10256: defect (bug): Autosave while typing title creates permalink too soon (closed: wontfix)"&gt;#10256&lt;/a&gt;, I'd like the core-devs to consider making an addition to the permalink edition section.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Currently, whenever I correct/update my post's title and want the permalink to reflect the update, I need to do the following:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;double-click permalink OR click Edit button ;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;delete content of textfield OR update text (a second time!) ;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;click Save button.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I'd put my vote for a button (or link) on the left of the permalink's Edit button, named "regenerate permalink", that would make that whole process quicker.
&lt;/p&gt;

In Ticket &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/9432" title="#9432: defect (bug): Output Broken: Ticket for collecting patches to proplery encode script ... (closed: fixed)"&gt;#9432&lt;/a&gt; multiple changes were collected to imporvide the output quality.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In a recent compare of my codebase to the current SVN one I saw that some there provided changes for codepress.html are still missing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Therefore I created this new ticket to get a ticket to add patches.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #10256 (Autosave while typing title creates permalink too soon) created</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Autosave is a great help to prevent loosing one's post, but I just stumbled on a possible defect: autosave happened while I was typing my post's title. I was not yet done with typing, so while my fully-typed was of the form "aaaa bbbb ccc ddddd eee ffff", the permalink generated by the autosave was just "aaaa bbbb ccc".
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is not a big issue, since I can edit the permalink whenever I want, but this is still a hindrance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think autosave should be disabled while the focus is on the title.
&lt;/p&gt;

There are occasions where you some DB integrity is very desired. When dealing with accounting-related data, for instance: if you delete a user, you need to be sure that the query will fail if it's about to delete lines in your accounting.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying we should have a posts, pages, post_revisions, etc. tables. Just like you I like the fact that we're able to store attachments and cats and dogs in there.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When it comes to properly optimize the queries afterwards, joining posts with a table contains IDs from posts, comments, links and users won't fare as well as one on a table that contains IDs from a single one.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now, if we introduce some kind of node ID so as to ensure no two pieces of data in posts, comments, links and users share the same numeric ID, that's a different story. Generic meta and term2node tables then makes perfect sense. But that's a much more massive change.
&lt;/p&gt;

Docblocks and comments should be provided for clarification. Addtionally current codebase can add a check for other types then arrays. Currently there is only array and else. This is quite broad.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
IMHO this should at least be documented with the &lt;em&gt;add_magic_quotes()&lt;/em&gt; function.
&lt;/p&gt;

Are you are wanting to see the terms/term_relationships/term_taxonomy table go away?  Can I assume because you want to see foreign key constraints?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here is my perspective and I've got over 20 years database experience on several different platforms as a developer, as a trainer, and as a book author. In my earlier years I was very much into 3rd normal form, referential integrity, explicit tables and relationships and so on. What I found was complexity quickly ratcheted up and significant flexibility was lost with that approach.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since I'm worked with both Drupal and WordPress I've really come to appreciate the elegant simplicity and flexibily of the models used and would never go back to the other if I could help it. I really think that enforcing referential integrity at the database level would be a real mistake. If you want an enterprise class app that evidently doesn't use database-level foreign key constraints take a look at SAP.
&lt;/p&gt;

Using Internet Explore 8 on Windows Vista.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Everything worked fine when using document.autosave.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Everything also worked fine when using window.autosave.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I do not know why IE doesn't like autosave by itself. Neither prefix should be required.

On display with permalinks active, store the permalink in meta for future reference in case it's not in the meta already. In such a case, scan post_meta for other occurrences of this permalink. On conflict, delete the older one in order to give pre-eminence to the newer data.
So, basically the same as what's done with the old_slug meta, except that it would work for anything stored in the posts table (rather than merely posts), and that it would work when the post's date changes, when a page's parent changes, when the site's permalink structure changes, etc.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hmm. So only URLs that have a corresponding entry in wp_posts? While most of what I used it for are URLs for custom post types I do have URLs that are completely
virtual.  It would be nice to preferable to have a list of links rather than have it be required to be associated with a post.

@dd32: A foreign key constraint can only reference a single table. Currently, a constraint on wp_term_relationships(object_id) referencing wp_posts(ID) would fail for this reason -- it could also be a link id. The performance implication is you cannot easily do: delete from wp_term_relationships where object_id = $post-&amp;gt;ID. Merging meta tables would lead us to similar problems.
&lt;/p&gt;

... that way you can have foreign keys and proper indexes everywhere. But it's a discussion we should be having during an IRC meet-up.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I dont see why you couldnt have a foriegn key.. They can be based on a Where column = 'blah' and ID = foriegn.id right?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
..Proper indexes can include multiple columns too..
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
No need for a huge number of tables, Only usermeta/postmeta are used at present, the others will have little usage for a few more revisions to come.. and i dont see the meta becoming a huge burden.

Personally, I'd rather see the schema changed as follows:

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;wp_posts
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;wp_postmeta
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;wp_users

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;wp_links
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;wp_linkmeta
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;wp_terms
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;wp_termmeta
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;wp_term2post
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;wp_term2link
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;wp_term2user (assuming we want that around too; this would allow us to manage user roles as a taxonomy)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
... that way you can have foreign keys and proper indexes everywhere. But it's a discussion we should be having during an IRC meet-up.

I'd personally like to see this take the route of an established plugin being included in core rather than a new item built.. Or at least, A looking at existing plugins, and deciding to go from scratch if theres a real reason to.

@mike: Dunno... Just for reference, what I'd like to do is add some extra meta:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On display with permalinks active, store the permalink in meta for future reference in case it's not in the meta already. In such a case, scan post_meta for other occurrences of this permalink. On conflict, delete the older one in order to give pre-eminence to the newer data.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
(It's worth discussing doing the same for unpaged taxonomy and author pages as well.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On 404, the canonical redirect would then scan old permalinks in case the REQUEST_URI is a known one, and redirect with a 301 code if a piece of data is found.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, basically the same as what's done with the old_slug meta, except that it would work for anything stored in the posts table (rather than merely posts), and that it would work when the post's date changes, when a page's parent changes, when the site's permalink structure changes, etc.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Anyway, I'm assuming your plugin would continue to work fine as long as WP isn't returning a 404 error when your data gets called.
&lt;/p&gt;

Thanks for the links.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What of the idea to have a flexible meta table for the "lesser" objects like links, terms, and whatever object a plugin developer might need meta for?  Does a wp_othermeta work?
&lt;/p&gt;

Will you implement in such a way that a plugin that implements fully-custom URLs will not be hampered by this update and will also be able to hook in and submit it's older URLs?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I have a plugin I've built that handles fully custom URLs based on post slug (mostly to support custom post types) and I want to ensure that it won't break and can also be able to record obsolete URLs for redirection.
&lt;/p&gt;

@wpnorris: you sure this works with static classes?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;class foo {
  function bar() {
  }
}
add_action('hook', array('foo', 'bar'));
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I might be wrong, but I believe foo-&amp;gt;wp_filter_id++ is fatal in some php versions.

The following plugin was written for 2.2 and still holds true to this day.  I am using it with a different structure than the authors...
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
/%category%/%postname%/
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This plugin has solved all the issues.  But, why is this still a bug in the core?  Seems to be a pretty big issue to me!  I have spent 2 hours 2x fixing this issue.  I sure hope I don't forget or have the need to use this plugin on the next update of Wordpress!
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
unfortunately, this patch has a major problem with objects that don't already have wp_filter_id set.  One value is stored as wp_filter_id on the object(&lt;code&gt;$filter_id_count++&lt;/code&gt;), but an entirely different value is appended to the index that gets returned (&lt;code&gt;isset($wp_filter[$tag][$priority]) ? count((array)$wp_filter[$tag][$priority]) : 0;&lt;/code&gt;).  Therefore, it's completely impossible to remove a filter on an object that was added in this way.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It seems like everyone is okay with the idea of using a static counter variable.  If that's the case, then there is no need to mess around with the array size of &lt;code&gt;$wp_filter[$tag][$priority]&lt;/code&gt;... just use the counter.  And if $priority isn't being used in this manner, then it is no longer needed.  This actually greatly simplifies this method, as the following patch shows.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Whenever I click Update to update the contents of two different Custom Fields, I get "An unidentified error has occurred." in pink at the bottom of the Custom Fields area of Edit Page.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It appears to be related to the fact that the value of the two Custom Fields involved begin with a first line made up of only the two characters "?&amp;gt;".  When I remove the first line, the error disappears.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Despite the error message, the Custom Fields do appear to be updated correctly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I am using the Default Theme.  This error occurs in the three browsers that I have tested:  IE8, IE8 in Compatibility Mode, and Firefox 3.0.10.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Can you elaborate to what you mean by "when we address permalink history?" Maybe provide a ticket link?  Thanks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As for adding several meta tables I'd ask that we consider possibly adding one for comment_meta (which could be very large) but use an abstract solution for items such as links and terms that are likely to have orders of magnitude less records than posts or comments. This would also allow anyone to add meta for any arbitrary object type without having to add custom tables.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If we only add explicit meta tables i.e. wp_linkmeta, wp_termmeta, etc. this issue will come up over and over when people want meta for some new object type (including "meta meta") plus we'll be littering the database with tables. Better to address it once now moving forward than having to constantly readdress it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As for user meta, I have yet to work on a project that needs advanced user meta so currently I have no experience nor opinion on user meta.
&lt;/p&gt;

while we're on the same topic, this, in wp-pass.php, seems like garbage:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;if ( get_magic_quotes_gpc() )
	$_POST['post_password'] = stripslashes($_POST['post_password']);
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
should be:

get_the_password_form() should use https for the wp-pass.php link in the form action attribute if secure logins are configured.  This is probably as easy as using site_url('wp-pass.php', 'login')
&lt;/p&gt;

cool. the one for shortcodes is unneeded if we change add_shortcode() to use:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;	if ( is_callable($func) )
		$shortcode_tags[$tag] = $func;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
to something like:

I uploaded picture Aktivní_stáj_schéma.jpg. Then select Thumbnail and set Link URL to original picture file. Then tried to insert into post. But only following code (with missing URL) appears:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;&amp;lt;a href=""&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src="http://localhost.cz/Wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/Aktivní_stáj_schéma-300x148.jpg" alt="Aktivní_stáj_schéma" title="Aktivní_stáj_schéma" width="300" height="148" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5503" /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I tried also 2.8.1-beta1, but in this case thumbnail was not probably created and after inserting into post there is another problem with URL link to original file:

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It is not problem of unique picture, because I renamed it to Test.jpg and then everything worked.

I went ahead and committed the simple cases for 2.8.1. I want to test the shortcodes.php one a bit more.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
WP_Widget_Recent_Posts in default-widgets.php doesn't work with persistent caching enabled.  This is because the function RETURNS the list of recent posts retrieved from the cache rather than prints the list of recent posts to the screen.  The fix is trivial.  Replace "return" on line 530 with "echo".  (A simple patch is attached.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Reproducibility instructions.  Enabled persistent caching. (i.e. upload/enable a version of object-cache.php which supports your caching backend.)  Observe that no output is created for the WP_Widget_Recent_Posts widget.
&lt;/p&gt;

We've got sync issues again...
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yeah, +1 for reverting in 2.8.1 branch, -1 to reverting in trunk, Get some testers on it and actually fix the transport with issues.. Chances are, someone else will fall victim to it in future if curl isnt available.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
My understanding is it was changed along with esc_html(), yeah. Because some theme and plugin authors were using it to escape things that really needed esc_html().
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The wp_specialchars() should not be used on that call anyway: it's completely bogus. That function is meant to turn things into HTML entities. I mean, either the theme author ensures whoever edits the css is allowed to post unfiltered html, either he uses proper escaping functionalities, such as HTML Purifier. But definitely not something that is an enhanced htmlspecialchars().
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Denis, the theme adds its CSS like this:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;$basefontfamily = wp_specialchars(stripslashes(get_option('blogtxt_basefontfamily')));
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Removing wp_specialchars fixes the issue.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Is it expected for wp_specialchars to break things like this in v2.8?
&lt;/p&gt;

more likely is that it tries to do: &amp;lt;?php&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/php?&amp;gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
if we get that part fixed, I'm pretty sure your plugin will work again, and we'll kill two birds with one stone.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Good question. Till now I was happy not to mess with the balance code ;-) But I'll take a look into it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Probably the PHP code gets intentionally changed by the balance code to avoid hacking?!? Just a guess...
&lt;/p&gt;

nope, that's totally theme related. the author is probably using something like esc_js() for css.

Ah, makes more sense... How difficult would it be, in your opinion, to fix balanceTags() to play well with exec-php and the various plugins that do the same thing?

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Having a case like your example is a "bug" in the post markup. I agree that the common user is glad if it is fixed by auto balancing the tags.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If the user choose not to balance tags, then he expects that WP will not balance tags in any way at all.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Besides that, ticket 9765 breaks my Exec-PHP plugin if the user writes PHP code before the &amp;lt;!--more--&amp;gt;. In this case force_balance_tags tries to "balance" the PHP code resulting in breaking the code leading to PHP parse errors.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Maybe this has something to do with WP2.8.  Looking at the XHTML source, I see things like this in the inline CSS blog.txt is inserting:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;{font-family:&amp;amp;#039;trebuchet ms&amp;amp;#039;}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I’m attaching the whole HTML head.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
when you add foo_bar_foo, the _ get processed as italic.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
whereas with markdown extra, they'd be treated like literal _.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
When I create a page with page slug for example "киро"
then when I try to open domain/киро - Error 404 - Not Found
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The permalinks are %postname%
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Post slug with this slug is working just fine, the same BUG exists in 2.7, 2.7.1 and 2.8
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Or, at most, switching this back to balanceTags() after the more... tag. But I still think it should stay the way it currently is.

perhaps, but on the other hand, it fixes multitudes of errors related to things like:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
foo &amp;lt;!--more--&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
which are guaranteed to break much about every theme. suggesting wontfix.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
In ticket &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/9765" title="#9765: defect (bug): Erroneous balanceTags call? forceBalanceTags should be used? (closed: fixed)"&gt;#9765&lt;/a&gt; balanceTags was replaced with force_balance_tags. This is causing tag balancing for the teaser although a user might have disabled tag balancing in the blog configuration.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This breaks plugins that are relying on unmodified teasers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If the user doesn't want tag balancing the blog should behave so - not only in some cases. If it breaks her HTML then she still can change the post to make it valid.
&lt;/p&gt;

@codedread: possibly. the thing here is that we're only hiding the issue under the rug. what's really needed is a proper escaping mechanism for whatever we don't want wpautop to touch.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
attaching my latest escape code for reference.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
btw, another option is to only filter on SVG elements/attributes that have camelCase:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Elements:
altGlyph|altGlyphDef|altGlyphItem|animateColor|animateMotion|animateTransform|clipPath|feBlend|feColorMatrix|feComponentTransfer|feComposite|feConvolveMatrix|feDiffuseLighting|feDisplacementMap|feDistantLight|feFlood|feFuncA|feFuncB|feFuncG|feFuncR|feGaussianBlur|feImage|feMerge|feMergeNode|feMorphology|feOffset|fePointLight|feSpecularLighting|feSpotLight|feTile|feTurbulence|foreignObject|glyphRef|linearGradient|radialGradient|textPath
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Guess that's still a lot of elements to filter on though.
&lt;/p&gt;

No, there is still "Loading" for Plugins and two Feeds widgets in IE8 (and nothing displayed in Firefox 3). Only Incoming links started to show default text "This dashboard widget queries Google Blog Search so that when..." instead of Loading message.

      <description>&lt;i&gt;Milestone&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Replying to &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5183#comment:19" title="Comment 19"&gt;mikeschinkel&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This ticket will likely get fixed in 2.9 indirectly, when we address permalink history. In the meanwhile, punting it back to Future pending patch.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Personally, I'd be +1 to adding several meta tables (comment_meta, link_meta, term_meta), and abstract the meta functions if needs be to fix the issues in user_meta. A unique meta table that includes the user_meta is a no go due to WPMU considerations. And combining the rest is a no go, imo, for performance reasons (the index is too large).
&lt;/p&gt;

This page &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://hacks.mozilla.org/2009/06/html5-video-fallbacks-markup/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://hacks.mozilla.org/2009/06/html5-video-fallbacks-markup/&lt;/a&gt; has some &amp;lt;video&amp;gt; markup, and it seems wordpress inserts &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; for each new line inside the video, which makes it invalid HTML.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Wordpress should either gain knowledge about &amp;lt;video&amp;gt; (and &amp;lt;audio&amp;gt;) in particular and not insert &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; between the &amp;lt;source&amp;gt; elements, or it should avoid inserting &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; inside unknown elements.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class="changeset" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/11595" title="Require all plugin page requests (?page=) to be for registered plugins ..."&gt;[11595]&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="changeset" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/11596" title="Require all plugin page requests (?page=) to be for registered plugins ..."&gt;[11596]&lt;/a&gt; introduced checks to make sure that one can load only plugin pages that have been registered.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The problem is that it fails before the backwards-compatible redirect has a chance to do its thing.  That backwards-compat redirect, in wp-admin/admin.php, makes sure that plugins pointing at edit.php?* get redirected to the 2.7+ tools.php pages.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Patch adds an entry in $_registered_pages for 'edit.php'-based hooknames for each 'tools.php'-based hookname.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #5183 (General Meta-Data Table) updated</title>
      
        <dc:creator>mikeschinkel</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Tue, 23 Jun 2009 17:08:53 GMT</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;i&gt;Version&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Milestone&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This came up as a discussion on the hackers list because of my need for link metadata as I wanted to do it how it might evolve to be done in future versions of WordPress.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The consensus on the list was to move everything to a wp_meta table and scribu nicely submitted ticket &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10223" title="#10223: defect (bug): Php notice : undefined index in upload.php (closed: fixed)"&gt;#10223&lt;/a&gt; although he was pointed back to this one. Here it seems the consensus is that a single meta table is too abstract and will add too much overhead for most people's liking. Further this ticket has stalled without addressing the problem.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So let me take a stab at a strawman.  Let's keep wp_postmeta and wp_usermeta but lets add a more generic table called wp_othermeta and let's use it for comments, links, or whatever. It would need an object_type field, of course but this would give anyone the ability to add meta to anything they need and should be a good balance of the concerns expressed thus far.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
BTW, I selected "General" as a "Component" because there was no "Meta" to select.
&lt;/p&gt;

I'm thinking we should revert &lt;a class="changeset" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/11524" title="Preferred transport: move curl to last position and fockopen to 2nd ..."&gt;[11524]&lt;/a&gt;.  DD32?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think those expecting http.php to be able to fetch authenticated urls were also bitten by no longer preferring curl. Granted, we really need to have a capability for this and create a list of auth capable transports, but the old way happened to work for lots of people.
&lt;/p&gt;

Several variables are unecessarily wrapped in "double quotes" when echoing/assigning/etc. Let's pull them out to gain a millisecond or three.

I found also, this &lt;em&gt;overload&lt;/em&gt; option contains additionally a bug inside PHP &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=27421"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=27421&lt;/a&gt; and much more important, can be used to exploit or crash domains on the same server &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://www.securityspace.com/smysecure/catid.html?id=800373"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://www.securityspace.com/smysecure/catid.html?id=800373&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This looks like dynamic runtime overload of other vhost's from neighbor vhost at same server using .htaccess file option.&lt;br /&gt;
Sounds to me like more buggy code scenarios are inside because of difference between CLI and Apache run.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #10244 (metaWeblog.getPost XML-RPC method should return the correct date/time ...) created</title>
      
        <dc:creator>josephscott</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Tue, 23 Jun 2009 15:50:46 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10244</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10244/1245772246000000</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Because WP uses post_date_gmt database field internally to trigger certain events draft posts don't get a valid date/time (it uses 0000-00-00 00:00:00), but they do get a valid post_date entry in the DB.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
XML-RPC clients run into problems when calling metaWeblog.getPost on drafts because of this.  The dateCreated field uses the DB post_date field for the draft and the date_created_gmt uses the post_date_gmt DB field.  So the response has dateCreated with a valid date and date_created_gmt with some screwy date (usually 1969 or 1999).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Seems the more correct thing to do would be to provide the right GMT date/time in the date_created_gmt field for drafts.  I'm including a patch that will populate the date_created_gmt field when metaWeblog.getPost is called on a draft by calling get_gmt_from_date() and then tweaking the result to be correctly formatted for the XML-RPC response.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I consider this a bug and would like to see it get into the 2.8.1 release.
&lt;/p&gt;

upgraded to 2.8 and it nuked the courier font in Theme blog.txt 4.6.1 and defaults it to Times font. all other font options seem to work.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
OSX 10.5.7, latest Camonio/Firefox/Safari.

I checked -- the CLI uses the same php.ini and all the values are the same. And, most importantly,  the functions are actually overloaded.
&lt;/p&gt;

I quickly tested the patch against trunk and 2.8-branch, and everything seems to work OK, both in removing and in adding contact methods.
&lt;/p&gt;

It requires to reboot Apache Server after changing this setting.
Without a reboot the &lt;em&gt;php.ini&lt;/em&gt; is cached and Apache doesn't notice this change.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I reoot apache on every change of php.ini. The problem isn't with apache. It works (fails) as expected. The interesting thing is that in the CLI it never fails. I am sure the overload option is set to 2, there.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This sounds interesting and should also be inverstigated. Maybe the CLI takes a different &lt;em&gt;php.ini&lt;/em&gt; than Server (different environment path lookup) ?
I think, the unit test may also require a "live" testing mode using a real servered page by Apache.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;function add_twitter_contactmethod( $contactmethods ) {
  // Add Twitter
  $contactmethods['twitter'] = 'Twitter';
  // Remove Yahoo IM
  unset($contactmethods['yim']);
  return $contactmethods;

Replying to &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10236#comment:3" title="Comment 3"&gt;nbachiyski&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The overload issue was fixed in &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://trac.glotpress.org/changeset/138"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://trac.glotpress.org/changeset/138&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Could a committer sync the php files from glotpress/pomo with wp-includes/pomo? That should do the trick.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As a side note. I couldn't reproduce the execution time exceed in a CLI script. I added a unit test, to keep track of the issue:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://trac.glotpress.org/browser/trunk/t/test_mo.php#L112"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://trac.glotpress.org/browser/trunk/t/test_mo.php#L112&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
However, even if using the same file which causes problems when accessed from a browser, the CLI test runs fine and reads the MO file properly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It requires to reboot Apache Server after changing this setting.
Without a reboot the &lt;em&gt;php.ini&lt;/em&gt; is cached and Apache doesn't notice this change.
&lt;/p&gt;

Changed the way the patch works, now simply adding a private function to wp-admin/includes/user.php that is called in the few spots where the contactmethods are needed.

This bug has been reported &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://www.wordpress-fr.net/support/viewtopic.php?pid=118675"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;on the fr_FR forum&lt;/a&gt; back in Feburary, and &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://www.wordpress-fr.net/support/viewtopic.php?pid=138079"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;it is still true for 2.8&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Some plugin add another item in the Media menu. While this is perfectly acceptable, some translation might already use the full width for the three default items (see first attached capture), and therefore any additional item would be pushed to a second menu line.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That should be no problem, but in effect that second menu line pushes the first one off-screen, leaving only the second one to be seen (see second attached capture).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The translation has since been reduced, but the issue remains: the menu should be able to handle numerous sub-lines, just because the use might want to use many item-adding plugins...
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Is there some reason we're not just using get_option('home')here?  As in:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;if ( !$requested_url ) {
     // build the URL in the address bar
     $requested_url  = ( !empty($_SERVER['HTTPS'] ) &amp;amp;&amp;amp;
        strtolower($_SERVER['HTTPS']) == 'on' ) ? 'https://' : 'http://';
     $requested_url .= get_option('home');
     $requested_url .= $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'];
   }
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I mean... the database is supposed to have the guaranteed correct path to the site -- that *is* what the 'home' option is for, isn't it?
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Note that the patch I provided does protect against the malicious characters in question, but I do not believe it does it at the right place - it only checks comments via the web form and not all possible means (not trackbacks, search queries).
&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10241/1245758165000000</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
My Video Quicktags plugin has had on and off reports about it breaking the sending of pingbacks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A user of the plugin has reported to me that the issue is due to an apostrophe in an HTML comment inserted into the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; by my plugin: &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/128694"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/128694&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
we analysed the Ping Bug of your Plugin. XMLRPC wants to check the page that is pinging and returns the Error 17: "The source URL does not contain a link to the target URL, and so cannot be used as a source."&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Problem is the "'" in &amp;lt;!-- Viper's Video Quicktags line 2651 of Version 6.2.5&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When XMLRPC executes "$linea = strip_tags( $linea, '&amp;lt;a&amp;gt;' );" and your Plugin is running only other stuff will show. Not right the Content.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Assuming this was indeed the cause, shouldn't WordPress be smarter than that?
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
But i'm afraid there have to be spend more time to solve all inside SimplePie, because i did now some more safety checks inplace (additional patches) and got now the Quick edit back and also some feeds but in the last 2 feed boxes now this occures:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;Fatal error: Maximum execution time of 60 seconds exceeded in C:\Program Files (x86)\xampp\htdocs\_root_wp28\wp-includes\class-simplepie.php on line 3087
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This is related to the destruction of SimplePie element here:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;	/**
	 * Remove items that link back to this before destroying this object
	 */
	function __destruct()
	{
			unset($this-&amp;gt;feed);
	}

Oh now i understand.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I suggest you submit the patch upstream to the SimplePie bug tracker then as well.

I've added a first patch, it's a bit rough on the edges, as I was especially unsure where to store the "default" variables, as they have to be available both in the admin and the frontend...
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
simply nothing requires javascripts is working.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Have you disabled All plugins and switched to the default theme? Some plugins load incompatible versions of Javascript libraries, such as jQuery, which can cause issues like no JS loading..
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yes, i did. WP 2.8 in pure install, default theme and no plugins.
The Dasboard is damaged because of
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Fatal error&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;:  Trying to clone an uncloneable object of class ReflectionClass in &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;C:\Program Files (x86)\xampp\htdocs\_root_wp28\wp-includes\class-simplepie.php&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt; on line &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;11740&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
this is again driven by a missing PHP 5 test even if the constant now respects mis-configuration:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;	function SimplePie_Parse_Date()
	{
		$this-&amp;gt;day_pcre = '(' . implode(array_keys($this-&amp;gt;day), '|') . ')';
		$this-&amp;gt;month_pcre = '(' . implode(array_keys($this-&amp;gt;month), '|') . ')';
		static $cache;
		if (!isset($cache[get_class($this)]))
		{
			if (extension_loaded('Reflection'))
			{
				$class = new ReflectionClass(get_class($this));
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
No safety test is made to test if a PHP 5 can be used.
&lt;/p&gt;

Looks like missing input validation for the comments. This leaves WordPress open to encoding related attacks btw. The "Yellow Screen Of Death" is a minor problem then.
&lt;/p&gt;

Thanks for reporting and providing the information.

I attached a patch for SimplePie disables PHP 5 usage more specific but this doesn't solve the malfunction of Dashboard or entire WP. Furthermore no TinyMCE Editor can be used, simply nothing requires javascripts is working.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Please check and test it, why this set WordPress out of function in this way.
&lt;/p&gt;

Heres the code for others:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;   if ( !$requested_url ) {
     // build the URL in the address bar
     $requested_url  = ( !empty($_SERVER['HTTPS'] ) &amp;amp;&amp;amp;
        strtolower($_SERVER['HTTPS']) == 'on' ) ? 'https://' : 'http://';
     $requested_url .= $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'];
     $requested_url .= $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'];
   }
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
if &lt;code&gt;$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']&lt;/code&gt; is empty, wp-settings.php fills it, You might want to take a look at the code for that in there and see if you can see anything overwriting it. The only real changes i see to that code are enhancements for IIS.
&lt;/p&gt;

I upgraded to beta1, but problem persists.
Memory usage:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;header: 11976896
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;footer: 12118936
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So, it looks like it is not memory related issue for me...

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Right now the Contact Info is a "fixed" set of values: Email, Website, AIM, Yahoo IM, Jabber / Google Talk. With the advent of the the_author_meta functions, the way has been cleared for this entire thing to be filterable, so people can add and remove their own contact options from within a plugin.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This would require, if I'm correct, for the Contact Info to be a loop through an array of contact options, and that array has to be filtered, with the exception of the E-mail address, which should always be available.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thoughts and remarks are very welcome :)
&lt;/p&gt;

"Be sure all your plugins are deactivated" is not desirable at all. There are hooks in the upgrade API that would become totally useless. Better check, using readme.txt files whether the plugins are compatible with the latest and greatest WP, and suggest deactivating those that aren't.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;i&gt;Cc&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I'm having the original issue (Incompatible archive PCLZIP_ERR_BAD_FORMAT (-10) : &lt;strong&gt;Invalid archive structure&lt;/strong&gt;)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The http.php from &lt;a class="changeset" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/11450" title="Trim tailing whitespace"&gt;r11450&lt;/a&gt; fixes the issue for me.  I put my original http.php file back and it immediately broke again.  I hacked it to keep it from deleting the archive, and I'll attach a couple to this ticket.  The server is a brand new dedicated box from Layered Tech with:
cPanel        11.24.4-RELEASE Build 36167
Apache        2.2.11 (Unix)
PHP        5.2.9
MySQL        5.0.81-community
Kernel        2.6.18-128.1.14.el5
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Running CentOS 5.  I've only moved one site to it so far, and I'd be happy to supply any additional information or even give a regular here access to it if they think it would help diagnose.  The site (&lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://geekreprieve.com"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://geekreprieve.com&lt;/a&gt;) is a personal site of no consequence that I moved to the server just to test it.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
At wp-admin/edit-tags.php, there are some situations where confirmation for tag deletion doesn't work as expected.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;After Quick edit and update a tag, clicking on Delete action immidiately deletes the tag without confirmation.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol start="2"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add a new tag and click on Delete under the newly created tag, confirmation dialog will popup but pressing cancel won't stop the process.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Also the same for the category editing.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Looks like SimplePie can take a lot of memory or even crash on some specific server configurations and/or PHP versions. The normal WordPress admin memory usage with 3-4 (not memory hungry) plugins is about 11 - 12MB, well below the 32MB that is set as maximum.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Unfortunately when that happens the page doesn't work properly as most JavaScript is supposed to load in the footer and is missing. The above patch is mainly a workaround for this.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Add something like:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;?php echo memory_get_usage(true); ?&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
to admin-header.php and admin-footer.php to see the memory used at the beginning and end of any admin page.
&lt;/p&gt;

Geez the code in canonical.php didnt post at all right.  let me try that again.  Here's at line 45:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
if ( !$requested_url ) {
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt; build the URL in the address bar
$requested_url  = ( !empty($_SERVER&lt;a class="missing wiki"&gt;HTTPS?&lt;/a&gt; ) &amp;amp;&amp;amp;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
strtolower($_SERVER&lt;a class="missing wiki"&gt;HTTPS?&lt;/a&gt;) == 'on' ) ? '&lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://&lt;/a&gt;' : '&lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://&lt;/a&gt;';
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$requested_url .= $_SERVER&lt;a class="missing wiki"&gt;HTTP_HOST?&lt;/a&gt;;
$requested_url .= $_SERVER&lt;a class="missing wiki"&gt;REQUEST_URI?&lt;/a&gt;;

      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10234#comment:6/1245719209000000</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I figured it out, and it's REALLY arcane.  Get some Coke.. this is going to take a bit.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When the root index.php file runs, it requires blog-header.php.  When this runs, it requires 'template-loader.php.  Line 7 in 'template-loader.php' which is very nearly the first thing this module does is:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
do_action('template_redirect');
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This calls 'redirect_canonical' in canonical.php.  No $args have been set up for the template_redirect and the $requested_url parameter to this function is null.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This causes the following code, on line 45, to execute:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
if ( !$requested_url ) {
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt; build the URL in the address bar
$requested_url  = ( !empty($_SERVER&lt;a class="missing wiki"&gt;HTTPS?&lt;/a&gt; ) &amp;amp;&amp;amp;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
strtolower($_SERVER&lt;a class="missing wiki"&gt;HTTPS?&lt;/a&gt;) == 'on' ) ? '&lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://&lt;/a&gt;' : '&lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://&lt;/a&gt;';
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$requested_url .= $_SERVER&lt;a class="missing wiki"&gt;HTTP_HOST?&lt;/a&gt;;
$requested_url .= $_SERVER&lt;a class="missing wiki"&gt;REQUEST_URI?&lt;/a&gt;;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
}
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And herein lies the problem.  My site is hosted on a Concentric Unix server. PHPInfo returns the following:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
PHP Version 4.4.8
System:        SunOS www.stevenmbooth.com 5.10 VDE sun4v
(MySQL is 4.1.22, but it's not germaine here)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And here's the bottom line. My wordpress home directory is '&lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://www.stevenmbooth.com/wordpress"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://www.stevenmbooth.com/wordpress&lt;/a&gt;'. $_SERVER&lt;a class="missing wiki"&gt;HTTP_HOST?&lt;/a&gt;, above, returns 'www.stevenmbooth.com' and '$_SERVER&lt;a class="missing wiki"&gt;REQUEST_URI?&lt;/a&gt;' returns null, and this produces The INCORRECT PATH.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
These results cause the above code to construct the url '&lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://www.stevenmbooth.com"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://www.stevenmbooth.com&lt;/a&gt;' as the redirect URL, and the browser immediately redirects to my root page, which causes my old index.html web site to initialize (I'm installing the WP site in the directory stevenmbooth.com/wordpress'.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
SO... Either that redirect line at the beginning of template_loader is completely wrong (doubtful), or we need to use something other than HTTP_HOST to detect the root directory for WP (see &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://www.nabble.com/When-HTTP_HOST-does-not-point-to-the-blog-td18097138.html"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://www.nabble.com/When-HTTP_HOST-does-not-point-to-the-blog-td18097138.html&lt;/a&gt; ).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
OH.. and I do believe this is a problem in 2.8.x as well, and that's why 2.8.x doesn't work for me.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, you see, the problem was actually with WP's interaction with my Apache server, and not my site or my templates.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The question is... what do we do to fix this?  What's the right way to detect the home install directory for WP?  Assuming it's HTTP_HOST seems to be incorrect, here.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Geez.  I wish I could charge you for the 12 hours it's taken me to find this.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
:)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

this might be related to the memory issue addressed with 2.8.1 beta.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My issue was solved with upgrading to the beta, but upgrading plugins fail unless disabling plugins on a blog with many plugins. Dashboard widgets also fail unless plugin count reduced ("500 internal server error" in firebug). javascript menu animations do still work tho :)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
possibly relate: A client's (high traffic) blog on a mosso/rackspace cloud server was slowed to a crawl today do to MySQL issues that I believe may have been resolved on there end. Is it possible that was do to a similar memory problem?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So if I understand properly, this and many other open tickets are a result of Wordpress requiring more memory then is available on the server, is this right?
&lt;/p&gt;
