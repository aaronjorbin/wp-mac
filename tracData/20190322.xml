Hi @MorgunovVit,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thanks for taking the the time to comment. Sorry for the frustration of your users. As stated above, this was done by design in the classic interface. There are several plugins mentioned above that maintain category hierarchy for selected categories. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Also, please read through &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38934" title="#38934: defect (bug): Bug with Category selector view when using child categories (closed: duplicate)"&gt;#38934&lt;/a&gt;. In that ticket, I detailed how the behavior was changed in the new block editor so the hierarchy of selected categories is maintained. Since the block editor was introduced in 5.0 as the new editing experience, only bug fixes will be considered for the Classic Editor moving forward.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #46612 (The Next Leap Forward for WordPress: Business Operations Data ...) updated</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
@dmillerweb wanted to give you a little bit more feedback directly related to your idea.  The Google document can use a good rewrite that would help you and any eventual developer get a clearer picture of what your goal is.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'd recommend removing all the fluff from the document.  The fluff being anything that's not related to a more technical view of what you're proposing. Telling me that this idea is the best thing since peanut butter met jelly doesn't give me any idea about what the benefit of your proposal is to me.  Save all of that marketing pitch until you have a product that you can sell (whether for money or not).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Between my reading of the document and your comments, I feel like you understand more of what you want that's not clearly shown in the write up. Nothing wrong with that.  Everyone writes things down thinking other people just know things they don't.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Start out with defining what the problem is.  You can certainly pull from your current experience.  For example, Business Operations Data Application allows the user to create a distinct collection of fields from multiple, related DBs and easily create and edit new rows of data.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Define what is already out there that may provide, albeit not via WordPress, that provides the kind of solutions your looking to build.  Could be Microsoft Access, could be Business Objects, etc.  Then anyone you're working with now has a visual of functionality you believe they need.  Any product you list is going to have positives and negatives, so make sure to include that info about what functionality you think is missing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In my corporate world, when we are approached with a request to build something, the first thing we do is give them an Excel document and say, "Write out your user stories."&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This document makes them think about the district functionality of their request which is broken into Epics.  So, for example, one Epic could be &lt;strong&gt;Welcome/Navigation Pages&lt;/strong&gt;, another &lt;strong&gt;Locate Manager Funds Page&lt;/strong&gt;.  Then each Epic is broken down into distinct actions on that page, like &lt;strong&gt;As the user, I want to be able to select the manager funds page so I can be direct to the correct page&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You may also benefit from creating some Balsamiq mockups as well, visuals help so much in explaining things.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And don't be discouraged by others and my comments. I'm currently building a new SaaS service which I have a clear picture of what it's going to do and how it's going to benefit people.  I tried to explain it to a co-worker and it took 20 minutes of explaining what I thought was a *simple* concept.  I went back to my developer and admitted I need to work on my elevator pitch.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Feel free to ask any questions you want, I'm on the WP Slack at &lt;strong&gt;Mark W&lt;/strong&gt; Same profile image I have here.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Good luck!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;i&gt;Component&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Thanks for the patch @oztaser. Dashicons is &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/WordPress/dashicons"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;managed externally in a repo on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The font was recently updated to be generated with a new build process. Instead of changing the character in this stylesheet, we need to investigate why this character was removed from the font, and it needs to be added back for backwards compatibility.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I can work on this Monday, but feel free to investigate this before then if you’d like. Pinging @joen.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

I like the dialog from 04.png and the button from Exit-Orange.png.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

We could even put a message in the footer, just in case you missed it....&lt;br /&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
@TimothyBlynJacobs Good catch on recovery mode not working if header already sent. In 45989.7.diff, I fix this issue. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As for your other feedback, I think it is impossible to display a message once the render has started. It is important to know what has already been rendered. Some example of page types. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;XML - RSS feeds
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;JSON - rest api
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;JSONp - Rest api
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;string - ajax request
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;xmlrpc - xmlrpc.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;html - front / back end.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
There is just no way to know what format to output in. If it is html, you dont even know if the body tag has been opened. I don't think this is something we can fix in 5.2 / phase 1.Unless I am missing something. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

BTW, discussion can absolutely continue with the ticket status set to closed, but I wanted to be realistic about the likelihood of the core team working on this in the immediate future. And tickets can be re-opened given new information. &lt;br /&gt;

      <description>maybelater: &lt;p&gt;
@dmillerweb thanks for proposing this idea. I am sure that for many it has the potential to provide a lot of value.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That said, the &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://wordpress.org/about/roadmap/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;WordPress Roadmap&lt;/a&gt; has 9 focuses for 2019 and some fairly large project for after that as well and all continue the idea of WordPress being software for website management along the lines of the project's mission to democratize publishing. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So for the foreseeable future, I view this as plugin territory. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
@mdwolinski Thanks for that input. Developing this concept as a plugin would be just fine. I'm not cemented into core integration on this. I appreciate your perspective. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In any case, I am thoroughly convinced we NEED this capability, and so far, it's just not there. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While I don't have your experience with corporate reporting, I do have more than a dozen years experience building database-driven applications which large companies and small businesses use to run much of their day-to-day operations. These are NOT just reporting tools, unless I have a mistaken impression of what you mean by that. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I believe it would be ideal to have this furnished by WordPress or Automattic, but I'd be tickled to work with any provider that wants to put together a tool like this that would be eminently usable by any intermediate-level WordPress developer. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sigh. It may be that I have to bite the bullet and go hire some programmers to write this for me, but I'm not sure I'm ready for that. Yet. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thanks again. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
To my mind, not everyone will agree, its a wordpress v5.1 bug.  My hosting company has had tracking pixels turned on for YEARS and previous version of Wordpress worked fine.  I backed out to v5.0.3 and it works fine.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Having said that, the Wordpress developers are among those who don't agree with my assessment and as such are not, so far as I can tell by responses here, prepared to accept responsibility and fix the bug. So if you want a solution, as I and other did, get your hosting company to turn off tracking pixels / statistics, you are probably not using the statistics that it gathers anyway - I wasn't.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

If this is the correct place for the test can we reverse the  &lt;code&gt;version_compare&lt;/code&gt; So we don’t need &lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Hi David,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First, I'm not a core developer.  I am, however, a Project Manager/Developer of internal enterprise sites for a large global entertainment company. So, take my perspective with that grain of salt.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
From reading through your linked Google document, it would appear to me that you're essentially suggesting a reporting tool along the lines of Tableau or Business Objects.  More so Business Objects with it's ability to create universes that connect multiple datasources together into one.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'm wondering why you feel this would need to be part of core?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It seems to me that what you're proposing would be ideal as a plugin, whether developed by Automattic, an independent developer or you (or a developer you hire ;-).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The reasoning behind it being developed as a plugin is two fold, first from my understanding any new added functionality to the core is first developed as a plugin to test it out before it's merged into core (see Gutenberg as an example).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Second, the functionality you're proposing doesn't need to be part of core to be functional, ie it gains nothing by being included as part of core.  So, if developed as a plugin, then it can be installed by anyone who would be interested in such features (see WooCommerce, Jetpack, bbPress, BuddyPress all great and robust functionality added as plugins)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are probably businesses (and individuals) who would certainly appreciate by having a robust reporting tool available to them within WordPress, especially if it comes with prebuilt reports based on the WordPress tables.  I could certainly see companies who could potentially develop this as a plugin to build a business around.  Could also be a great feature plugin used by WordPress VIP and their customer base.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Interesting idea, but as someone who has used many reporting tools in the corporate environment, not easy to get right or easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

same here iam also unable to edit on my homepage in version 5.1.1..can anyone plz help and support how to resolve..? iam struglling from last 10 days and i have to release my site urgently...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
if its a bug in new version then what is the way to roll back to the older version ?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Assuming your problem is the same as above, your hosting company is causing this problem by inserting code into various files on the website. Call them and ask them to turn off tracking pixels. Tracking pixels are sometimes used to generate statistics, but in this case they are getting into places they shouldn't be. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Hi @arena &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Replying to &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44013#comment:21" title="Comment 21"&gt;arena&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Major issue with a form is ... spam, and then mail bounce ...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For sure, the potential for spam was the main driver behind working on this via a Feature Plugin rather than a patch for core.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Replying to &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44013#comment:21" title="Comment 21"&gt;arena&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I would prefer a dedicated mailbox (privacy[at]mydomain[dot]tld) &lt;br /&gt;
accessed via pop3 with a specific word in subject (export or erase) &lt;br /&gt;
that posts a request using wp_create_user_request&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That's an interesting setup idea and sounds pretty useful but feels like it would fall outside of core as the mailsetup and server action to either make a REST request or wp-cli request to trigger wp_create_user_request that would all have to be configured externally on your server outside of core.&lt;br /&gt;
That being said, the WP-CLI action to create the requests isn't built yet but is a part of the V2 privacy roadmap here;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/roadmap/privacy/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://make.wordpress.org/core/roadmap/privacy/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
And as to the REST request, there's not currently an endpoint specific to requests but as they're simply a custom post so the Posts endpoint can be used for that;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/reference/posts/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/reference/posts/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you do move forward with your concept would love you to share your findings with the team and if there's any blockers hampering you from accomplishing that request flow.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thanks for sharing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Apologies @dmillerweb! I think @afercia explained it very well. Definitely did not mean to be dismissive. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I was just doing some triage when I saw the ticket come in to ensure it matches our usual workflows. &lt;br /&gt;

        <dc:creator>jadeddragoon</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Fri, 22 Mar 2019 19:17:05 GMT</pubDate>

Replying to &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39941#comment:29" title="Comment 29"&gt;mallorydxw&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If the server sends &lt;code&gt;Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'nonce-123abc'&lt;/code&gt; then the client will only execute scripts if the opening script tag contains &lt;code&gt;nonce="123abc"&lt;/code&gt;. This example would be impossible unless the attacker was able to guess the nonce value.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That would be true &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;if the JavaScript was not templated via PHP&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. But &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;client-enforced&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; CSP cannot see what's happening in the PHP code on the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;server&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. I already explained how this works in my last post. By templating JS via PHP wordpress does and has always provided a means of JS injection. Because templating === injection. This is why WordPress has such a bad reputation for XSS exploits. And you're providing a means to make sure all the templated JS has valid nonces. That means that if someone manages to insert their own code into the templated JS by exploiting poorly formed PHP... &lt;strong&gt;the XSS JS code &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; be in a script tag that has a valid nonce&lt;/strong&gt;. You're actually &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;removing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; the need for the attacker to guess the nonce by adding it for them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Replying to &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39941#comment:30" title="Comment 30"&gt;mallorydxw&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
By the way, the proof-of-concept plugin I mentioned in the description of the report is here now as I changed my github username: &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://gist.github.com/mallorydxw/e2aee45ad5cb2a309c6bd0fc213efb97"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://gist.github.com/mallorydxw/e2aee45ad5cb2a309c6bd0fc213efb97&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This would be even worse! With this they don't even have to find templated js that explicitly requests a nonce nor request one themselves... even existing WordPress XSS exploits can take advantage and future exploits don't have to ask for the nonce specifically.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
@dmillerweb thanks for your feature request. Keywords and ticket properties are used to generate reports on this bug tracker (also known with the loving name of "Trac"). &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Custom, manually set, keywords are sometimes used to group together tickets that don't fall into one of the preset keywords. Yout ticket is unique so maybe a custom keyword is not necessary. See &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/contribute/trac/keywords/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/contribute/trac/keywords/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Severity and Priority are more appropriate to bugs rather than feature requests, see &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/contribute/trac/#ticket-properties"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/contribute/trac/#ticket-properties&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Version: mainly used to indicate the earliest version affected by a bug.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Pretty sure those changes were not meant to dismiss your proposal in any way :) Thanks again.&lt;br /&gt;

How about orange?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I really like that. I chose blue as it felt an action to me but orange also works well and calls attention nicely. I would like to have an information notice combined still as a first 'hey just so you know'.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
An additional note is that recovery mode isn't cleared when the user logs out. If it did, it'd be difficult to test/reproduce errors that occur during the login process ( which is one of the most important actions ). &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Could the information notice re-appear once log back in again?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I still think we should run recovery mode even if headers have been sent, otherwise we are going to regress when errors are displayed in some form.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Then we could render the error template conditionally. Perhaps, allow it if headers have been sent, but we haven't started rendering actual HTML? On the front-end that'd perhaps be something like &lt;code&gt;did_filter( 'template_include' )&lt;/code&gt;, not sure about the admin.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

(closed: fixed)"&gt;#43987&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44350" title="#44350: task (blessed): Block plugin updates if required PHP version is not supported - ... (closed: fixed)"&gt;#44350&lt;/a&gt; plugin updates were blocked from the UI if the PHP requirements were not met. This should be extended to prevent an auto update from skipping this check and being installed automatically.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think doing the same &lt;code&gt;requires_php&lt;/code&gt; checks from the UI in &lt;code&gt;WP_Automatic_Updater::should_update()&lt;/code&gt; would work.&lt;br /&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Discussed with @xkon and he said the UI that was calling &lt;code&gt;WP_Debug_Data::get_directory_size()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;WP_Debug_Data::get_database_size()&lt;/code&gt; was removed because of the issues with large directories. So we can reimplement that if we can get some protections in place to prevent timeouts. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;WordPress is the unquestioned leader&lt;/strong&gt; for building new websites, either by people or businesses managing their own sites, or increasingly by developers building websites for clients. In spite of the fact that WordPress is a database-driven application, and already has some robust database tools, there is currently NO capability for WordPress website developers to build database applications to run the operations of their business or organization. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While there ARE some plugins that allow building tables and even SaaS applications for database application, all of them fall short in affordability, flexibility, documentation, completeness, and/or ease-of-use. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;PROPOSAL:&lt;/strong&gt; Develop a Business Operations Data Application Development (BODAD) capability for WordPress. This should either be a part of the WordPress core, or a fork of WordPress, so developers can download a core with this capability or without it. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;SPECIFICATIONS OUTLINE:&lt;/strong&gt; A more complete proposal and outline of the specifications for this BODAD project are in a Google Document, at&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k4Y5bc2ES3bsLfhrz8tcP36bV85kWAbgkRXYS91PY08/edit?usp=sharing"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k4Y5bc2ES3bsLfhrz8tcP36bV85kWAbgkRXYS91PY08/edit?usp=sharing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;MY ROLE:&lt;/strong&gt; I have more than 35 years programming experience, more than 20 years experience developing business database applications, including 5 years as project manager. I have been building websites since 1995 and began working with WordPress in 2009. While I have moderate fluency with PHP and MySQL, I am relatively inexperienced in the WordPress Core, but would be happy to work with the project management team to bring this project about.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;BENEFITS:&lt;/strong&gt; This project will be the "Next Leap Forward for WordPress" in that it will expand its capabilities beyond being the best brochure-style website platform in the world, to being the platform of choice for the hundreds of thousands of developers with clients who need an online, database-driven, business operations management system.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I am enthusiastic and confident that this project is needed, wanted, and will see a mushrooming explosion of demand as more and more developers see what they can do with it. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Finally, I'm not sure what to do from this point, so I'm turning it over to you, the WordPress core development team, with a request to let me know how I can help with the project. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thanks, and take care,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;David in Mississippi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Something simple like that @karmatosed ? (See with-excerpt.PNG​ )&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yes, I think it probably could even just a 'one off' notice. Just something that explains what this is and why someone wouldn't be worried as it's helpful.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Add a new filter &lt;code&gt;sites_pre_query&lt;/code&gt; - which returns null by default. Return a non-null value to bypass WordPress's default &lt;code&gt;get_sites&lt;/code&gt; queries.&lt;br /&gt;

Developers should note that filtering functions that require pagination information are encouraged to set the &lt;code&gt;found_sites&lt;/code&gt; property of the &lt;code&gt;WP_Site_Query&lt;/code&gt; object, passed to the filter by reference. If &lt;code&gt;WP_Site_Query&lt;/code&gt; does not perform a database query, it will not have enough information to generate these values itself.&lt;br /&gt;

Does the icon need to be a part of the title link? It almost makes it feel like the icon is part of the title itself.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I agree. I am not sure it should be as we don't in other cases.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exclude the https test for &lt;code&gt;localhost&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Switch dotorg communication check to point to api.wordpress.org
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Few questions/notes:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Where should we add &lt;code&gt;$upload_dir['basedir']&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;get_template_directory()&lt;/code&gt;, since they aren't constants?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;WP_Debug_Data::get_directory_size()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;WP_Debug_Data::get_database_size()&lt;/code&gt; are not actually called anywhere. Probably need to hear from @Clorith where those were supposed to be used.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We should add a wordpress.org documentation page about https to point to. LetsEncrypt doesn't really have anything that fits the "what is this and why is it important" questions.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</description>

I reported an issue here:  &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/14562"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/14562&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A contributor there referred me to post this here because it might not be a Gutenberg issue. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In a multisite network, the Toolbar site displayed after My Sites is changed to the root of the site when the admin User adds the Toolbar to the URL so they can edit the page. The Edit Page is also not displayed in the Toolbar.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Steps to reproduce the behavior:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
login to WordPress&lt;br /&gt;
-- in a multisite network&lt;br /&gt;
select one of your multisites&lt;br /&gt;
verify the correct site is loaded after My Sites&lt;br /&gt;
create a simple test page&lt;br /&gt;
publish the test page&lt;br /&gt;
copy the link for the page and open the link in a new tab&lt;br /&gt;
paste ?bar=yes to the url and press return on the url to display the toolbar&lt;br /&gt;
notice that the multisite display after My Sites shows the main root site now instead of the multisite you are in based on the url you selected&lt;br /&gt;
notice that the Edit Page does not show either&lt;br /&gt;
Expected behavior:&lt;br /&gt;
The selected site should display properly after My Sites and the Edit Page should display to the User.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
used WordPress 5.1.1 and the Gutenberg release installed with this version&lt;br /&gt;
OS: Windows 7 Enterprise&lt;br /&gt;
Browser chrome Version 73.0.3683.75&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It could possibly relate to Gutenberg because a test of 4.9.10 with Gutenberg plugin not installed and Gutenberg not a part of WordPress core in that release doesn't have that problem.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

@zodiac1978 sorry that was confusing for you to read out of context, let me clarify. Every week the design team runs a triage session. This came up during it. I was offering up the issue for discussion to the group attending. I wasn't bringing any judgement as it was something everyone was able to give insight on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
@melchoyce &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6" title="#6: defect (bug): the_excerpt() on non-excerpt posts doesn't stripslashes (closed: fixed)"&gt;#6&lt;/a&gt;C7781 is ok on the white zebra striped rows. But on the light gray zebra striped ones (#f9f9f9) contrast is only 4.34:1, see &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://jdlsn.com/color/?type=hex&amp;amp;color=6C7781&amp;amp;color2=f9f9f9"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://jdlsn.com/color/?type=hex&amp;amp;color=6C7781&amp;amp;color2=f9f9f9&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ah, good catch, I only tested on white — we'd need to go one level up and use &lt;code&gt;#606A73&lt;/code&gt; instead to meet contrast on both.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Does the icon need to be a part of the title link? It almost makes it feel like the icon is part of the title itself.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;uses local vs class variables for $network_ids and $site_ids
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;removes unrelated whitespace changes except those fixable by &lt;code&gt;phpcbf&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
viewing the diff with whitespace changes disabled the changes are now very small - &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://cl.ly/e61374e40f16"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://cl.ly/e61374e40f16&lt;/a&gt; (or view here and turn off whitespace changes under diff settings: &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/pull/49/files"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/pull/49/files&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;

No worries @kartiks16 best of luck finding the cause, I would definitely check if that install with the issue has WP-GDPR plugin in place as I assume that's the cause and would just need a plugin update or touch base with their support. Cheers&lt;br /&gt;
*Let us know if you do find any issues on a clean install.&lt;br /&gt;

@Clorith What about just making it a normal paragraph there? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I've also been playing with dashicons on the section headers. Could help call some attention to Critical. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Hello:&lt;br /&gt;
When a scheduled post is saved, the created post date is keept, instead of the scheduled date the user wanted to program. So, when the user make a preview of the post, the date showed is incorrect, because not correspond to the scheduled post date but to the present date.&lt;br /&gt;
The date is corrected only when the post is programmed. I think the date of the post must be changed when the post was saved as a draft too.&lt;br /&gt;
Best regards,&lt;br /&gt;
Javier.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

By the way, the proof-of-concept plugin I mentioned in the description of the report is here now as I changed my github username: &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://gist.github.com/mallorydxw/e2aee45ad5cb2a309c6bd0fc213efb97"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://gist.github.com/mallorydxw/e2aee45ad5cb2a309c6bd0fc213efb97&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

      <description>&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With this patch, however, a malicious user could input specially formatted PHP code into the poorly sanitized inputs with the intent of injecting XSS JavaScript in the associated output&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But with your patch all inline JS templated via PHP will get marked as "supposed to be there" before being sent to the user... meaning that there is still no way to tell what inline JS is actually supposed to be there and what isn't.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Correction: this is not part of the WordPress patch I made. This is part of the proof-of-concept plugin I made.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If the server sends &lt;code&gt;Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'nonce-123abc'&lt;/code&gt; then the client will only execute scripts if the opening script tag contains &lt;code&gt;nonce="123abc"&lt;/code&gt;. This example would be impossible unless the attacker was able to guess the nonce value.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Hi @abircham, &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thanks for clarifying. I can now confirm the issue in IE11. I will submit a patch to fix this issue soon. I am changing the Component to General, because this is not just a Bundled Themes issue, it affects other themes as well.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thank you, I will re-insert the code for now then as a temp fix.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #46608 (Being in recovery mode is easy to not realise you are in it) updated</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Thank you for these explorations!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Is there any downside to being in recovery mode?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I would say there isn't a significant downside to being in recovery mode. The possible concern in my mind would be if they were on a shared computer. Someone might be able to bypass a security related plugin by causing it to fatal, making it easier to login since the recovery mode cookie would still be there. But being in recovery mode shouldn't be used as a substitute for any auth checks.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Outside of being on a shared computer, the worst that could happen is a plugin gets unexpectedly paused for causing a fatal error. Since this is local to the current user, it shouldn't be a significant issue, but it isn't ideal.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One advantage of having it in the menu bar is it could be something visible on the front end of the site. Additionally, right now if a plugin is paused on the front end, the user won't see any notice until they go back into the admin. This isn't there in core at the moment, but conceivably, we could add a notification of some kind to the admin bar that a plugin was just paused, or have a quick way of displaying all the paused plugins. Of course, the admin bar isn't showing on the front-end for all sites, but I think it might be worth exploring forcing the admin bar to display when in recovery mode.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
An additional note is that recovery mode isn't cleared when the user logs out. If it did, it'd be difficult to test/reproduce errors that occur during the login process ( which is one of the most important actions ). &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Just tested the patch and it does make the requested changes, however there is an unintended consequence when your comment contains a long non-breaking word/string. See screenshots above.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since this is not ready for 5.2 Beta 1, which is tomorrow and is a Feature Request. I am punting to 5.3&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Add new class dashboard-comment-wrap-no-avatar to keep the word-wrap property&lt;br /&gt;

Thank you for your comments. I have added additional custom CSS to the style sheet to overcome the issue. I will remove the code now so that you can see the issue and put it back in on monday.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The code I have used is:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
.wp-block-media-text:after {&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
display: table;&lt;br /&gt;
content: "";&lt;br /&gt;
clear: both;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
}&lt;br /&gt;
.wp-block-media-text figure {&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
float: left;&lt;br /&gt;
width: 50%;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
}&lt;br /&gt;
.wp-block-media-text .wp-block-media-text&lt;span class="underline"&gt;content {&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
float: right;&lt;br /&gt;
width: 50%;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
}&lt;br /&gt;
.wp-block-media-text.has-media-on-the-right figure {&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
float: right;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
}&lt;br /&gt;
.wp-block-media-text.has-media-on-the-right .wp-block-media-text&lt;span class="underline"&gt;content {&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
}&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
float: none;&lt;br /&gt;
width: inherit;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
}        &lt;br /&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Something simple like that @karmatosed ? (See &lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/46573/with-excerpt.PNG" title="Attachment 'with-excerpt.PNG' in Ticket #46573"&gt;with-excerpt.PNG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/46573/with-excerpt.PNG" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt; ), that's just a quick inline thing on an old patch I had, so ignore that styles etc aren't perfect, but essentially a WP admin notice of the info variety in that location is quick, if dirty.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

All future discussions and maintenance until this has a solid proposal for core will be made on it's ( really soon to come :) ) repo at &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/wordpress-privacy"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://github.com/wordpress-privacy&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'm marking this as a maybelater to keep our lists here clean as well and we'll either re-open or start fresh when it's time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thank you all for the comments and suggestions here!&lt;br /&gt;

How about orange? It stands out as more noticeable in the admin than blue, and we generally use it as "hey, look at me."&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Is there any downside to being in recovery mode? If so, I would want to make it even more prominent that you are in there. Maybe the notice is yellow or button is red or both. Or put a red border on the admin bar.&lt;br /&gt;
If there is no downside, maybe put a red bubble on the Dashboard link, and show the info message.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

I really like number 3. Anything in the black topbar gets lost. I feel the other notifications leave me searching again for the exit button/link, but number 3 presents it all together in a nice little package for me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I wonder if the notification message should have a yellow/orange left border? But I do get that it's really just an information msg.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

@karmatosed see &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/35497" title="#35497: defect (bug): List tables: Post format links improvements (closed: fixed)"&gt;#35497&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Previously, the icons were separated link pointing to the lists for audio, video, image, etc. formats. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now they're part of the post title links: they inherit the hover style from the post title links. No other reasons.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
@melchoyce &lt;code&gt;#6C7781&lt;/code&gt; is ok on the white zebra striped rows. But on the light gray zebra striped ones (&lt;code&gt;#f9f9f9&lt;/code&gt;) contrast is only 4.34:1, see &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://jdlsn.com/color/?type=hex&amp;amp;color=6C7781&amp;amp;color2=f9f9f9"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://jdlsn.com/color/?type=hex&amp;amp;color=6C7781&amp;amp;color2=f9f9f9&lt;/a&gt;. The blue &lt;code&gt;#0073aa&lt;/code&gt; is OK for both.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Fri, 22 Mar 2019 14:41:50 GMT</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Currently, the way recovery mode is indicated and left, is through a simple text link in the toolbar. This could be easy to forget you are in that mode and know how to leave.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I began exploring a few options you can see in attachments. The first attachment shows our current state.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add a message to say what state in: If this is dismissable it's easy to get into the same situation of not knowing. This does come down to finding out when it's ok to assume someone knows the mode.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol start="2"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add a message and put action button to exit in that message: I took an extreme version of this into mocks, including showing not dismissable.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol start="3"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Button in toolbar and message: This brings back dismissable message and makes the toolbar link into a button. I think this is our best balance for now.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;
My current feeling is going with option 3 and making the link a button in the toolbar. I would love others to explore this but I realise we have limited time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #46599 (Replace compatibility tests with new functions) updated</title>
      
        <dc:creator>afragen</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Fri, 22 Mar 2019 14:32:06 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/46599#comment:5</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/46599#comment:5/1553265126994692</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I initially wanted to use &lt;code&gt;is_wp_compatible()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;is_php_compatible()&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Similar code exists in most plugins that are designed to fail gracefully. Having this in core means not having to fiddle with the subtleties of &lt;code&gt;version_compare&lt;/code&gt; for many plugin authors. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Specifically having this test in a single location in core means that when having values in the &lt;code&gt;readme.txt&lt;/code&gt; headers is mandatory it will be easier to implement. Currently the &lt;code&gt;empty( $requires ) || version_compare…&lt;/code&gt; allows for this less stringent test. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think we could add a single line of code to ensure that whatever variable we pass to this function doesn’t generate a PHP  notice for potentially being undefined. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Great! thanks for the new &lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/45749/45749.7.diff" title="Attachment '45749.7.diff' in Ticket #45749"&gt;45749.7.diff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/45749/45749.7.diff" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt; - these are so similar I missed that they are different at first. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since they are so closely related, we can probably commit them together and I will expand my commit message to cover &lt;code&gt;networks_pre_query&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I am still seeing test failures in Travis for .5 &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://travis-ci.org/adamsilverstein/wordpress-develop-fork/builds/509713899"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://travis-ci.org/adamsilverstein/wordpress-develop-fork/builds/509713899&lt;/a&gt; and .7 &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://travis-ci.org/adamsilverstein/wordpress-develop-fork/builds/509934427"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://travis-ci.org/adamsilverstein/wordpress-develop-fork/builds/509934427&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

@afercia thanks for the context. Is there a reason this now does that over the way previously icons were treated? I'd love to know more.&lt;br /&gt;

      <pubDate>Fri, 22 Mar 2019 14:06:44 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/46585#comment:4</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/46585#comment:4/1553263604977972</guid>
      <description>&lt;i&gt;Version&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It's true that most of the discussion in &lt;a class="new ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32700" title="#32700: enhancement: Allow media attachments in nav menus (new)"&gt;#32700&lt;/a&gt; is about &lt;code&gt;nav-menus.php&lt;/code&gt;, but (if I'm getting my dates right) that ticket was also created before nav menus were added to the Customizer in WordPress 4.3. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In fact, it's possible to make attachments available in the Customizer today by filtering &lt;code&gt;register_post_type_args&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;add_filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'register_post_type_args'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'attachment'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'show_in_nav_menus'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
However, in my testing, searching for attachments still fails for the same reasons outlined in &lt;a class="new ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32700" title="#32700: enhancement: Allow media attachments in nav menus (new)"&gt;#32700&lt;/a&gt; related to &lt;code&gt;post_status&lt;/code&gt;. So, for parity between &lt;code&gt;nav-menus.php&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;customize.php&lt;/code&gt;, I was hoping that any fix to &lt;a class="new ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32700" title="#32700: enhancement: Allow media attachments in nav menus (new)"&gt;#32700&lt;/a&gt; would cover both cases before the ticket was officially closed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'm with you on the assumption bit, the current plugin iteration has an admin notice with a short excerpt on what the pages mean (one on each tab), I don't recommend using that moving forward, as it's a bit tacky thrown inline like that and doesn't work well with the overall view, but perhaps introducing some kind of help icon to show a short description could be the answer here?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I love the idea of a help icon or just something more introductory. I hate to suggest yet another notice but having something show up as a notice on start could help.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
If we wish to keep the empty checks I would propose adding an additional test to ensure the variable is set to something. The empty test in the original was to allow for a plugin that didn’t have a header set to be valid.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It appears that this commit will stop any plugin that doesn’t have one of the &lt;code&gt;readme.txt&lt;/code&gt; headers defined to be unable to activate. I’m not at my computer today so I can’t test. I would much rather see this reverted and figure out a better name in beta.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I've noticed when bolding the first word in a sentence, the editor strips the space out between the word you've bolded and the next one.&lt;br /&gt;
Essentially its putting &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; round the word so when the block saves it strips the space from after the closing strong tag, meaning the word after it has no spacing&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Uploading any image with the exact phrase '300x250' in the name doesn't display the thumbnail in the media library.&lt;br /&gt;
Viewing the inspector element, the thumbnail doesn't load but viewing teh image directly does show it exists.&lt;br /&gt;
I have tested this on versions 4.4.18 to 4.9.9 and the same behaviour exists.&lt;br /&gt;
Calling the images something different does display. E.G.&lt;br /&gt;
301x250&lt;br /&gt;
299x250&lt;br /&gt;
3000x2500&lt;br /&gt;
3x00250&lt;br /&gt;
30x0250&lt;br /&gt;
3002x50&lt;br /&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Hi!&lt;br /&gt;
The standard behavior of WordPress remains the same and it still causes discontent of many users. The destruction of the taxonomy hierarchy (with a relatively small number of categories) is perceived by the user as illogical, confusing behavior. Could you add a custom option in the admin settings with which user can specify the maximum number of categories after which the behavior changes? Those. if in the admin settings of the option "Display selected categories at the top of the list when the number of headings is reached:" the user sets 20. If the number of categories is less — let the system behave logically — display the hierarchy without violations. And if the categories quantity becomes 20 or more - the behavior of the system changes and the selected categories are displayed at the top of the list (as is happening now).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
We should keep the &lt;code&gt;empty()&lt;/code&gt; checks, as plugin API requests can be overridden, and the responses may not contain the &lt;code&gt;requires&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;requires_php&lt;/code&gt; field, triggering PHP notices. See &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31694" title="#31694: defect (bug): Notice warning in class-wp-plugins-list-table.php since revision 31831 (closed: fixed)"&gt;#31694&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reopened ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/33330" title="#33330: defect (bug): Undefined property: stdClass::$slug (reopened)"&gt;#33330&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a class="new ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44582" title="#44582: defect (bug): Notice: Undefined property:stdClass::$plugin - wordpress (new)"&gt;#44582&lt;/a&gt; for an example of similar notices.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/46599/46599.2.diff" title="Attachment '46599.2.diff' in Ticket #46599"&gt;46599.2.diff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/46599/46599.2.diff" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt; is a patch with &lt;code&gt;empty()&lt;/code&gt; checks. However, at this point, the new functions just become an alias for &lt;code&gt;version_compare()&lt;/code&gt; and don't offer any significant benefit or code reduction.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The naming of &lt;code&gt;wp_is_wp_compatible()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;wp_is_php_compatible()&lt;/code&gt; (as suggested in &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/43992#comment:41" title="Comment 41 for #43992: task (blessed): Prevent activation of a plugin if its required PHP version is too high (closed: fixed)"&gt;comment:41:ticket:43992&lt;/a&gt;) also sounds a bit weird.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'd think we should pull them for now, and discuss better naming and whether we actually need them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Fri, 22 Mar 2019 11:55:51 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/46604</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/46604/1553255751006907</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I noticed that if you have a published page set to a &lt;code&gt;Front Page Section X Content&lt;/code&gt; and that page is then set to &lt;code&gt;private&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;draft&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;pending&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;trash&lt;/code&gt; at some point in the future, the content still appears on the homepage. And if the page is deleted permanently, an error is shown and the content of the "Homepage" is shown again.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When going back into the Customizer &amp;gt; Theme Options, pages that do not have the status &lt;code&gt;publish&lt;/code&gt; no longer show up in the select box. This makes it unclear to the user what has happened.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Choosing &lt;code&gt;— Select —&lt;/code&gt; and publishing the Customizer changes removes the page(s), but I think that's a suboptimal experience.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It's easy enough to check the &lt;code&gt;post_status&lt;/code&gt; of the page before displaying the panel, but some thought will need to go into how to handle that situation in the Customizer.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

        <dc:creator>SergeyBiryukov</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Fri, 22 Mar 2019 11:49:54 GMT</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;i&gt;Focuses&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Hi @jayupadhyay01, welcome to WordPress Trac! Thanks for the patch.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$wpdb&lt;/code&gt; is already available here via &lt;code&gt;wp-load.php&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Per the &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/inline-documentation-standards/php/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;documentation standards&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;@global&lt;/code&gt; tag is meant to list PHP globals used within functions or methods.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Looking at other files in &lt;code&gt;wp-admin&lt;/code&gt;, it seems like we don't generally document &lt;code&gt;$wpdb&lt;/code&gt; in code that itself is in the global namespace. The standards don't say anything about it either.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So perhaps we should remove &lt;code&gt;@global wpdb $wpdb&lt;/code&gt; here instead. Introduced in &lt;a class="changeset" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/32642" title="Add `@global` annotations for `wp-admin/*`.
See #32444.

@DrewAPicture, do you have an opinion on documenting globals outside of functions or methods?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

I can reproduce this, via author user role, for:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;&amp;lt;div style="grid-template-columns:9% auto"&amp;gt;Testing&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I also noticed the same removal of &lt;code&gt;display: grid;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Out of curiosity I had a look at possible other grid CSS properties and here's the list so far:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;grid
grid-column
grid-row
grid-area
grid-gap
grid-column-gap
grid-row-gap
grid-template
grid-template-areas
grid-template-columns
grid-auto-columns
grid-auto-rows
grid-auto-flow
grid-column-start
grid-column-end
grid-row-start
grid-row-end
justify-self
justify-items
justify-content
align-self
align-items
align-content
place-self
place-content
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I might have missed some?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
These are unsupported in &lt;code&gt;safecss_filter_attr()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Hi,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At the moment there is a problem with updating the themes via WordPress. I use the theme Salinger by cmsmasters that was created on 5 May 2016: &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://themeforest.net/item/salinger-personal-blog-portfolio-wordpress-theme/15410788?s_rank=1"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://themeforest.net/item/salinger-personal-blog-portfolio-wordpress-theme/15410788?s_rank=1&lt;/a&gt;. But it appeared that now there is one more theme with the same name Salinger by GalussoThemes: &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://wordpress.org/themes/salinger/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://wordpress.org/themes/salinger/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As this theme has higher version, the WordPress offers to update my theme to this one: &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://www.screencast.com/t/InXjh9Zso"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://www.screencast.com/t/InXjh9Zso&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://www.screencast.com/t/7n5ybUwKP9"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://www.screencast.com/t/7n5ybUwKP9&lt;/a&gt; And update crashes the website, of course.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Could you please change the update algorithm so that not only the theme name will be checked when the new version is available, but also the theme author? It will resolve such issues with the themes that have the identical names.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

As per @afercia thoughts now icon is part of the menu link so color should be &lt;code&gt; #0073aa &lt;/code&gt; and hover color &lt;code&gt;#00a0d2&lt;/code&gt; as per link color. @melchoyce 3rd mock-up is perfect for icon color.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #46573 (Introduce a Site Health module for users to self-service their site) updated</title>
      
        <dc:creator>Clorith</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Fri, 22 Mar 2019 09:44:58 GMT</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Looking over the list of remaining issues from @pento first:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The debug tab is a little slow because it still performs some tests, like checking if we can send http requests to wp.org, this is also done by the site health check, so perhaps caching the results here would be an idea to speed things up.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;WP_Debug_Data::get_directory_size()&lt;/code&gt; was used to get the sizes of the various directories (plugins, themes, uploads), but when @afercia was testing he managed to cause a fatal error fro ma timeout when run on a development setup where npm_modules and vendor directories existed, causing the RecursiveIterator feature to run too long. If we are to re-introduce these as display options, we need a safeguard here, to ensure it doesn't run for too long, or take up too much memory. If either of those cases happen, it should break out early and just provide a "could not determine size" style message for that field.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I agree it would be nice if every single test had an actionable item, ideally one that solved the problem there and then, but for a first iteration I think linking to appropriate wp-admin pages, or documentation, is the best way forward.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We don't have a page that explains https to users as well as they do, yet, but it could be used as inspiration to provide good information in our own article if we were to write one.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Moving along to input from @karmatosed :&lt;br /&gt;
The health tests do run every time the site health page, although it is stored as a transient once completed, we could probably leverage this to either not run it on every visit to this page, or introduce a way to re-run things manually.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I totally agree with every item, even recommended ones, feeling urgent because of the badge labeling them as security-related items. Perhaps some of those tests can be classified as something else, or we could also look to use one of the other badge alternatives to not draw as much attention (there's a few styles included that have passed accessibility requirements to choose from)..?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I can't speak for the boxes within boxes, @hedgefield may be able to chime in on the process there, I _think_ the thought was to separate out a long list of often scary information into sections first (accordions) to make the page less daunting, and retain the tabular output of actual data for each section for easier reading (I could be mistaken, hopefully someone will correct me on that).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'm with you on the assumption bit, the current plugin iteration has an admin notice with a short excerpt on what the pages mean (one on each tab), I don't recommend using that moving forward, as it's a bit tacky thrown inline like that and doesn't work well with the overall view, but perhaps introducing some kind of help icon to show a short description could be the answer here?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #38545 (Add span element to get_the_archive_title()) updated</title>
      
        <dc:creator>Confridin</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Fri, 22 Mar 2019 09:17:08 GMT</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I tried another solution.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It does not add a span tag by itself, but it adds another filter. People will be able to easily add a span, for example:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;add_filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'get_the_archive_title_prefix'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'sx_archive_prefix'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;sx_archive_prefix&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$prefix&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'&amp;lt;span class=”helloworld”&amp;gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$prefix&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
They will also be able to remove or alter the begining of the function (ex. "Category: %s"). Here are some examples:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;An easy way to remove it:
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;add_filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'get_the_archive_title_prefix'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;__return_empty_string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;An easy way to change it:
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;add_filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'get_the_archive_title_prefix'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'sx_archive_prefix'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;sx_archive_prefix&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$prefix&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$prefix&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;str_replace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Category"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Awesome Category"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$prefix&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$prefix&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;An easy way to add other HTML tag:
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;add_filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'get_the_archive_title_prefix'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'sx_archive_prefix'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;sx_archive_prefix&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$prefix&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$prefix&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I think that the last solution is a bit tricky for various reasons:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;many wordress users and developers will never need a span here.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;some themes may already have CSS for &amp;lt;span&amp;gt; tags. Adding another &amp;lt;span&amp;gt; to this function may break their webdesign
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;it will be more complex to fix tickets &lt;a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/42768"&gt;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/42768&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31237"&gt;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31237&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I just went through and a few issue struck me to get resolved on top of reported ones (forgive me if they are also known about):&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; On first load or page reload for me, the '...' takes a really long time. Shouldn't it remember once it's set? I get this image for at least 10-20 seconds.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a style="padding:0; border:none" href="https://cldup.com/REdKvBoJvf.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cldup.com/REdKvBoJvf.jpg" alt="https://cldup.com/REdKvBoJvf.jpg" crossorigin="anonymous" title="https://cldup.com/REdKvBoJvf.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I seem to be seeing raw html tags. For example:
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a style="padding:0; border:none" href="https://cldup.com/KvWR2z3pIT.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cldup.com/KvWR2z3pIT.jpg" alt="https://cldup.com/KvWR2z3pIT.jpg" crossorigin="anonymous" title="https://cldup.com/KvWR2z3pIT.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Overall, there are some hierarchy issues. For example, critical to me needs more stand out styling. Right now visually 'security' stands out way more and that seems to make everything need doing.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a style="padding:0; border:none" href="https://cldup.com/3XwswU9N8r.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cldup.com/3XwswU9N8r.jpg" alt="https://cldup.com/3XwswU9N8r.jpg" crossorigin="anonymous" title="https://cldup.com/3XwswU9N8r.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'Show past tests' isn't a link it's a more loading button, maybe make it styled link that? It seems a weird experience to have it just drop content below.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a style="padding:0; border:none" href="https://cldup.com/ZJTJs2mUJA.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cldup.com/ZJTJs2mUJA.jpg" alt="https://cldup.com/ZJTJs2mUJA.jpg" crossorigin="anonymous" title="https://cldup.com/ZJTJs2mUJA.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I find site info being boxes inside boxes a little weird visually. I'd love to know the reason to just output.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a style="padding:0; border:none" href="https://cldup.com/QAjXCl2hbU.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cldup.com/QAjXCl2hbU.jpg" alt="https://cldup.com/QAjXCl2hbU.jpg" crossorigin="anonymous" title="https://cldup.com/QAjXCl2hbU.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'Hide options for copying this information' or 'Show options', doesn't really show options as much as just allow you to copy.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
As far as existing issues go:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Responsiveness: adding the same padding other pages have would be good, I think that's 10px.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Overall, I do feel this feature assumes a lot of knowledge about what it is and does. There is no explanation on the page it just says 'site health'. Whilst that's great if you know what it does, it's not great to assume.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

@bobbingwide I realise this is an old ticket but my own query (&lt;a class="reopened ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/46585" title="#46585: enhancement: Customizer: Add Media to Menus using media manager (reopened)"&gt;#46585&lt;/a&gt;) just got marked as a Duplicate thought it is slightly different (the same issue in Appearance -&amp;gt; Customize, NOT Appearance -&amp;gt; Menus)  &lt;br /&gt;
You previously said you had a workaround.  Do you still have a working solution you could share? Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

@dlh Thanks. However &lt;a class="new ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32700" title="#32700: enhancement: Allow media attachments in nav menus (new)"&gt;#32700&lt;/a&gt; is a similar but slightly different issue. &lt;a class="new ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32700" title="#32700: enhancement: Allow media attachments in nav menus (new)"&gt;#32700&lt;/a&gt; is to do with nav-menus.php (Appearance -&amp;gt; Menus) my query was related to the Menus in the Customizer (customize.php).  Though if that one was fixed I would use the older interface as it would solve the problem for end users.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
A quick runthrough here, and I notice that the issue template is using escape outputs. For &lt;code&gt;data.description&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;data.actions&lt;/code&gt; we should use unescaped output, as various inline styling and action links are included here, and escaping is handled in the ajax call.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Hello, minor aesthetic issue with the privacy cookie checkbox on comment forms. Seems there's no space between the checkbox and the text. Only seems to affect Twenty Nineteen&lt;br /&gt;

In the Twenty Nineteen theme the comment form design uses flexbox order CSS properties.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When contents are injected via the &lt;code&gt;comment_form_after&lt;/code&gt; they're expected to appear below the form, for instance the Akisment privacy message. Due to the flex order the contents instead appears before the form.&lt;br /&gt;

Hello @garrett-eclipse &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thank you for the detailed explanation and reviewing the ticket.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I will surely check again with fresh WP version and update you if I face any problem.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I will keep in mind the points you mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As of now, I am keeping this ticket as closed until I verify it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thanks again to everyone who got involved in this ticket and helped.&lt;br /&gt;

      <description>invalid: &lt;p&gt;
Hi @kartiks16 I hope this finds you well.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I took a look at your issue and what struck me right away was that WP Core only introduces the 'Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.' checkbox. &lt;br /&gt;
*Testing, This is consistent across all bundled themes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So the other three checkboxes on your screenshot come from your theme, plugins or custom code;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have read and accepted the Privacy Policy
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Notify me of followup comments via e-mail. You can also subscribe without commenting.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This form collects your name, email and content to keep track of website comments. For where, how, and why we store your data, check out privacy policy. I agree
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
*The last one if the one in question that falls below the submit button.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Doing some quick recon on the string of text it appears to be coming from the WP GDPR plugin;&lt;br /&gt;
wp-gdpr.eu/features/&lt;br /&gt;
*Their example seems to be above the button so you might have an outdated version or a conflict with your theme or another plugin.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As it's outside of core I'm closing this ticket, but please reach out to WP GDPR support either through the wp.org support forums if you're a free user or via their premium support. They'll be able to address the issue properly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wp-gdpr-core/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wp-gdpr-core/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
wp-gdpr.eu/support/&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
*Another plugin could be using the same verbiage, but I would check your plugin list to see which GDPR plugin you have in place and follow-up with their support.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Design improvements from @melchoyce.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A multitude of string tweaks.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Proper docblocks everywhere.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Removed the magic from &lt;code&gt;WP_Site_Health_Auto_Updates::run_tests()&lt;/code&gt;. (I definitely used an anonymous function, because we don't have to care about PHP 5.2 anymore.)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Combined the constant checks in &lt;code&gt;WP_Site_Health_Auto_Updates&lt;/code&gt; into one method.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Altered &lt;code&gt;WP_Site_Health::get_test_php_version()&lt;/code&gt; to use &lt;code&gt;wp_check_php_version()&lt;/code&gt;, and generally simplified it.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Removed &lt;code&gt;WP_Site_Health::json_wordpress_version()&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Simplified &lt;code&gt;WP_Site_Health::child_test_php_extension_availability()&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Switched the &lt;code&gt;manage_options&lt;/code&gt; permission checks to &lt;code&gt;install_plugins&lt;/code&gt;, to more accurately reflect whether a user is capable of finding out this information independently.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Changed the issue template to use &lt;code&gt;wp.template()&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Moved the menu item to Tools.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Things still to be done, but I think they can all wait until after beta 1.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;HTTPS check shouldn't run for localhost, for which an SSL cert can't be generated.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;REST API failure due to loopback request failing is a weird error message.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The debug tab is really slow to load.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Test how &lt;code&gt;WP_Debug_Data::get_directory_size()&lt;/code&gt; deals with recursive symlinks.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;WP_Debug_Data::get_database_size()&lt;/code&gt; should differentiate between the WordPress database, and all databases on the server.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;From MySQL 5.7, you can get more accurate InnoDB table sizes from &lt;code&gt;INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INNODB_SYS_TABLESPACES&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-sys-tablespaces-table.html"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-sys-tablespaces-table.html&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The values of &lt;code&gt;WP_CONTENT_DIR&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;WP_PLUGIN_DIR&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;$upload_dir['basedir']&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;get_template_directory()&lt;/code&gt; should be shown.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;show_count&lt;/code&gt; behaviour needs to be better translatable. Drop-ins should show the count, too.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Needs better responsive styling.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;WP_Site_Health::get_test_dotorg_communication()&lt;/code&gt; should talk to api.wordpress.org.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Convert all of the actions to buttons. (eg, &lt;code&gt;WP_Site_Health::get_test_php_version()&lt;/code&gt;)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add actions for all tests, so site owners can do something with the information.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The documentation link in &lt;code&gt;WP_Site_Health::get_test_https_status()&lt;/code&gt; should go to a wordpress.org page, or perhaps letsencrypt. Not Cloudflare.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All text needs reviewing.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

I agree with @karmatosed and @afercia about avoiding italics and introducing the indent. And supplied an existing example of increasing the font size of the intro as @jameskockelbergh suggested which I agree gives it a better distinction.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/45484#comment:4/1553226028425577</guid>
      <description>&lt;i&gt;Keywords&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Patch can be tested by adding this code to twenty-nineteen's &lt;strong&gt;functions.php&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;add_action( 'after_setup_theme', 'add_testing_theme_support' );
add_action( 'customize_register', 'add_testing_customizer_settings' );
function add_testing_theme_support() {
	add_theme_support( 'starter-content', [
		'attachments' =&amp;gt; [
			'test' =&amp;gt; [
				'post_title' =&amp;gt; 'testing for post ID',
				'file' =&amp;gt; 'screenshot.png',
			],
		],
		'theme_mods' =&amp;gt; [
			'testing' =&amp;gt; [ 1, '{{test}}', 3 ],
			'testing_string' =&amp;gt; '{{test}}',
		],
		'options' =&amp;gt; [
			'testing' =&amp;gt; [ 1, 2, '{{test}}' ],
		],
	] );
}
function add_testing_customizer_settings( $wp_customize ) {
	$wp_customize-&amp;gt;add_setting( 'testing' , [
		'default'     =&amp;gt; 0,
		'transport'   =&amp;gt; 'postMessage',
	] );
	$wp_customize-&amp;gt;add_setting( 'testing_string' , [
		'default'     =&amp;gt; '',
		'transport'   =&amp;gt; 'postMessage',
	] );
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If you're not using a &lt;strong&gt;fresh_site&lt;/strong&gt; install, you will need to manually force that state, you can add this to the same &lt;strong&gt;functions.php&lt;/strong&gt; file:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;update_option( 'fresh_site', 1  );
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Now go into the customizer, and you will get PHP warning for not being able to preg_match on the values passed as they are arrays, like these:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;[22-Mar-2019 03:25:50 UTC] PHP Warning:  preg_match() expects parameter 2 to be string, array given in /srv/www/wordpress-default/public_html/wp-includes/class-wp-customize-manager.php on line 1526
[22-Mar-2019 03:25:50 UTC] PHP Warning:  preg_match() expects parameter 2 to be string, array given in /srv/www/wordpress-default/public_html/wp-includes/class-wp-customize-manager.php on line 1544
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Now apply patch, and follow the same steps.  You should no longer receive PHP warnings.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
From the browser console, you can verify the correct value is set in the array for the theme_mod using the customizer js api:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;wp.customize( 'testing' )();
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The code for options vs theme_mods is pretty much identical, so it could probably be consolidated if necessary. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The patch does the following steps for theme_mods and options:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;serialize value with &lt;strong&gt;maybe_serialize()&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;check for post symbol matches on strings.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;replace these strings with post ID ints.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;unserialize value with &lt;strong&gt;maybe_unserialize()&lt;/strong&gt; so values can be properly used.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</description>

&lt;a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/44978"&gt;r44978&lt;/a&gt; provides for new compatibility functions &lt;code&gt;wp_is_wp_compatible()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;wp_is_php_compatible()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let's use those functions in all the places we needed them before they were in core.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;WP_DEBUG_LOG&lt;/code&gt; may be set to file, and a file not in the public folder tree. In that case it's not potentially public, IMHO.&lt;br /&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
@spacedmonkey Thanks! Running tests on &lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/45749/45749.5.diff" title="Attachment '45749.5.diff' in Ticket #45749"&gt;45749.5.diff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/45749/45749.5.diff" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt;, code looks good.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Does this look good for the commit message?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Multisite: add a &lt;code&gt;sites_pre_query&lt;/code&gt; filter to short circuit WP_Site_Query queries.&lt;br /&gt;
Add a new filter &lt;code&gt;sites_pre_query&lt;/code&gt; - which returns null by default. Return a non-null value to bypass WordPress's default &lt;code&gt;get_sites&lt;/code&gt; queries. Similar to the &lt;code&gt;posts_pre_query&lt;/code&gt; filter for WP_Query added in &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/36687" title="#36687: feature request: Feature to override WP_Query to provide results from other source (closed: fixed)"&gt;#36687&lt;/a&gt;. This filter lets you short circuit the WP_Site_Query query to return your own results.&lt;br /&gt;
Developers should note that filtering functions that require pagination information are encouraged to set the &lt;code&gt;found_sites&lt;/code&gt; property of the WP_Site_Query object, passed to the filter by reference. If WP_Site_Query does not perform a database query, it will not have enough information to generate these values itself.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
For the first iteration, I'd like to simplify things a bit.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/43992/43992.23.diff" title="Attachment '43992.23.diff' in Ticket #43992"&gt;43992.23.diff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/43992/43992.23.diff" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt; reads the &lt;code&gt;Requires at least&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Requires PHP&lt;/code&gt; headers from both &lt;code&gt;readme.txt&lt;/code&gt; and the main plugin file, with &lt;code&gt;readme.txt&lt;/code&gt; taking precedence.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Per &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/43992#comment:23" title="Comment 23"&gt;comment:23&lt;/a&gt;, this was done for plugins not hosted on w.org that may not have a valid &lt;code&gt;readme.txt&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
However, on w.org these headers are specific to &lt;code&gt;readme.txt&lt;/code&gt;, adding them to the plugin file does not have any effect.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since we don't generally have any special treatment for plugins not hosted on w.org anywhere else in core, I wonder if by reading the headers from both places in this particular function (and advertising them as plugin headers vs. readme headers) we make things more complicated and confusing to plugin authors.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/43992/43992.24.diff" title="Attachment '43992.24.diff' in Ticket #43992"&gt;43992.24.diff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/43992/43992.24.diff" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt; is a simpler implementation that only reads the headers from &lt;code&gt;readme.txt&lt;/code&gt; and makes &lt;code&gt;validate_plugin_requirements()&lt;/code&gt; more consistent with &lt;code&gt;validate_plugin()&lt;/code&gt;. For Beta 1, I think we could go with that, and then iterate further as needed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #46597 (Grid properties stripped from style attribute after saving post) created</title>
      
        <dc:creator>ryelle</dc:creator>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
When resizing a Media and Text block, something like &lt;code&gt;style="grid-template-columns:9% auto"&lt;/code&gt; is added to the rendered markup. If you're not admin (don't have unfiltered_html?), this is stripped by saving (in &lt;code&gt;safecss_filter_attr&lt;/code&gt;, I think), which then causes the block to not match and appear "invalid".&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This can also be reproduced with plain content, using the HTML block:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use an "author" level user
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add an HTML block
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add the content  &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div style="grid-template-columns:9% auto"&amp;gt;Testing&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Save the post and reload the page
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The style attribute has been stripped
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</description>

@spacedmonkey - We can add it in the same patch - is this the code in &lt;a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/45749/45749.diff"&gt;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/45749/45749.diff&lt;/a&gt; ? I missed that separate code earlier, usually diffs are cumulative :)&lt;br /&gt;

@adamsilverstein This ticket is for both wp_site_query and wp_network_query filters. Is it possible to add the network query in the same patch or should this be a different ticket?&lt;br /&gt;

      <title>Ticket #45895 (maybe_unserialize: handle exceptions thrown during unserialization) updated</title>
      
        <dc:creator>bluefuton</dc:creator>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Thanks for looking into this @desrosj!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I understand your &lt;code&gt;wontfix&lt;/code&gt; decision here, but just wanted to add some additional details in case someone returns to this one.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The exception I saw was thrown in PHP 7.2.13 and it was definitely during unserialization. Using the code in the description, I received:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;object(Exception)#1 (7) {
  ["message":protected]=&amp;gt;
  string(52) "Unserialization of 'SimpleXMLElement' is not allowed"
  ["string":"Exception":private]=&amp;gt;
  string(0) ""
  ["code":protected]=&amp;gt;
  int(0)
  ["file":protected]=&amp;gt;
  string(25) "/home/wpcom/test-php7.php"
  ["line":protected]=&amp;gt;
  int(7)
  ["trace":"Exception":private]=&amp;gt;
  array(1) {
    [0]=&amp;gt;
    array(4) {
      ["file"]=&amp;gt;
      string(25) "/home/wpcom/test-php7.php"
      ["line"]=&amp;gt;
      int(7)
      ["function"]=&amp;gt;
      string(11) "unserialize"
      ["args"]=&amp;gt;
      array(1) {
        [0]=&amp;gt;
        string(28) "O:16:"SimpleXMLElement":0:{}"
      }
    }
  }
  ["previous":"Exception":private]=&amp;gt;
  NULL
}
NULL
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
We encountered this on WordPress.com in a place where we unserialize post meta. One site had an empty SimpleXMLElement serialized in post meta (apparently created by a site importer). We now handle the exception outside of &lt;code&gt;maybe_serialize&lt;/code&gt; in that scenario.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Uploaded a new patch. &lt;a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/45989/45989.6.diff"&gt;45989.6.diff&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This patch use headers_sent as the check. This is an improvement to what we had before as most use case of plugin hook were covered. Hooking in a fatal error to the wp_head action, still gave me a WSOD, but I am not sure how we can work around this. This should be committed ASAP. &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Either of you have insights into the stats for the specific minor of 5.6 we want to use? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I pulled the stats for WP 5.x usage of PHP 5.6.x, summarised here: &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QtChQBycXJa5helEiDCWIH6EMFR5wZUr9NdfcJQ5djQ/edit#gid=0"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QtChQBycXJa5helEiDCWIH6EMFR5wZUr9NdfcJQ5djQ/edit#gid=0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Basically, 54% use the latest &lt;code&gt;5.6.40&lt;/code&gt;, 95% are &lt;code&gt;5.6.30&lt;/code&gt; and above, and &lt;code&gt;99%&lt;/code&gt; are &lt;code&gt;5.6.20&lt;/code&gt; and above (I don't like how round these numbers are.. :) )&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Most of the &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://php.net/ChangeLog-5.php"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;PHP 5.6 fixes&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;code&gt;5.6.25&lt;/code&gt; seem to be security-related, and that's the point I stopped looking into it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Sure @SergeyBiryukov - if you add this to twenty-ninteen's &lt;strong&gt;functions.php&lt;/strong&gt; file:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;add_theme_support( 'starter-content', [

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
When adding a date time control to the customizer using the WP_Customize_Date_Time_Control class with the add_control() method, the character for the day of the month suffix (S) is not replaced/stripped when formatting the date and gets displayed in the customizer.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
See attached image.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Like other date formatting characters, the suffix should either be replaced with the get_option( 'date_format' ) value or be removed completely.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Worth noting the icon is now part of the link. When hovering the link, the grey icon turns into blue anyways. Visually, that's not supre nice. I'd rather go with the default blue: when hovering it turns into the slightly lighter blue for hovered links.&lt;br /&gt;

      <title>Ticket #46595 (Allow more than one valid recovery mode link) created</title>
      
        <dc:creator>flixos90</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2019 22:09:10 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/46595</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/46595/1553206150859126</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
In the new recovery mode (see &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/46130" title="#46130: defect (bug): Only pause extensions for users with recovery access (closed: fixed)"&gt;#46130&lt;/a&gt;), it is currently only possible for a single recovery mode link at a time to be valid. That is because the key is stored in a &lt;code&gt;recovery_key&lt;/code&gt; option, with the latest key always overriding the previous one.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is not too critical at this point since those links are only sent via a rate-limited email, and due to that rate limit the link would expire when the next one is sent anyway. However, a future iteration of the recovery mode will allow additional ways of obtaining such a link, most likely via request by a user with sufficient permissions. This means multiple links need to be valid at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I talked about this with @timothyblynjacobs earlier, and we think the following would be a good fix:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Store key under &lt;code&gt;recovery_key_{$random_chars}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add &lt;code&gt;{$random_chars}&lt;/code&gt; to recovery link URL, so that it looks like &lt;code&gt;wp-login.php?action=enter_recovery_mode&amp;amp;rm_key={$key}&amp;amp;rm_lookup={$random_chars}&lt;/code&gt; (not sure about the term "rm_lookup", but that's the general idea.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When checking the key, get the option with the suffix &lt;code&gt;{$random_chars}&lt;/code&gt; that is included in the URL.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

Hi @dcooney and welcome to trac.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Are you able to provide details about the plugin/theme you're using with AJAX comments?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The comment-reply JavaScript uses a mutation observer for adding events for AJAX added comments, are you experiencing the problem in all browsers?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I just noticed this ticket as it was turned into a Future Release (good call imho as it might need a lot more discussion as well!). I can handle the Greek letters but I need some clarifications first please because I'm not sure where exactly &lt;code&gt;remove_accents()&lt;/code&gt; is needed &amp;amp; used for. I saw in core it's within &lt;code&gt;sanitize_title()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sanitize_user()&lt;/code&gt; but it might be on various other places or used in more broader scopes as well that I can't know at the moment.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Please bear with me and let me explain my thinking process and "issues" before creating a patch and if there's an outcome on what's actually needed I'll be more than happy to provide a patch for Greek letters.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The function itself is called "remove_accents()" that literally means removing accents. The description though in our Handbook says &lt;code&gt;Converts all accent characters to ASCII characters.&lt;/code&gt; and this is something totally different, in many languages removing an accent and converting to ASCII (Latin) is whole different story and changes everything.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For example:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Removing accent ( literally so both are Greek letters ):&lt;/strong&gt; ί = ι &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Converting to ASCII ( so altering the locale ):&lt;/strong&gt; ί = i&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Questions:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Where would &lt;code&gt;remove_accents()&lt;/code&gt; be actually used and for what purposes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As for example if it's used to create "slugs" or titles if we only add accented characters people will end up with a mixed slug or title by having Greek/Latin letters. So most likely in this case a "full" exchange of Greek -&amp;gt; Latin would be needed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;What is actually needed here?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If it's simply changing from an accented Greek letter to a non accented one it would be ok (I believe). If it's to remove accents for another reason and it's used to  try and convert everything into Latin maybe we need to split things up into &lt;code&gt;remove_accents()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;convert_to_latin()&lt;/code&gt; for example by introducing something new (if something equivalent doesn't already exist that I'm not aware of).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For me this isn't something as simple as it looks as for various Languages removing accents (if used to alter actual readable text) ends up on changing the meaning of the word as well.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Still could use some more attention on CSS to ensure we aren't redeclaring styles. I also don't like the repetitive code in the ajax functions now that the magic ajax calls have been removed, but it does prevent those at least. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

@audrasjb personally I like this new approach. Not my area of expertise though. I think there are two options:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;change this ticket (and the other related ones) to type: bug, as this is about security hardening and it was missed in the original ticket &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/43187" title="#43187: enhancement: Add pre-save filter to make target=&amp;#34;_blank&amp;#34; always secure (closed: fixed)"&gt;#43187&lt;/a&gt;. Having a few more days may help asking a review from the ones involved in &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/43187" title="#43187: enhancement: Add pre-save filter to make target=&amp;#34;_blank&amp;#34; always secure (closed: fixed)"&gt;#43187&lt;/a&gt; who have better knowledge on this issue
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;punt to 5.3 :)

@melchoyce if it's a link I sort of like the last option. However, looking at where we have icons and links in other situations,  I don't see an existing pattern of having the link color. Perhaps we can just increase contrast for now?&lt;br /&gt;

Does anyone know if this issue going to be addressed and fixed in the next version of WP or is it something that has to be addressed by the Web Host?&lt;br /&gt;

Thanks&lt;br /&gt;

Want to bump this so that people can't accidentally upgrade to a version they can't use. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
@dd32 @pento - Either of you have insights into the stats for the specific minor of 5.6 we want to use? &lt;br /&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Asked to a few SEO experts and the argumentations from @markcallen and @zodiac1978 seem the most appropriate. Core should not make assumption on the output. Also, core is far from supporting schema so this seems more plugins / themes territory and should be removed. Noting also that today, JSON-LD is preferred.&lt;br /&gt;
+1 for removal.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #46593 (Fatal error when running unit tests without the build directory) created</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
If you create a new checkout and attempt to run PHPUnit without running &lt;code&gt;grunt build&lt;/code&gt; first, you'll get a fatal error:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Fatal error: require_once(): Failed opening required 'build//wp-includes/class-phpmailer.php' in tests/phpunit/includes/mock-mailer.php on line 2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There should be a proper error message with a recommendation to run &lt;code&gt;grunt build&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add a new 'Attachments list' Heading above the attachments list.   Hidden using the &lt;code&gt;screen-reader-text&lt;/code&gt; class.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I tested this with voiceover and could hear the heading announced when I used the 'Next Heading' keyboard shortcut. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
@afercia I'm not certain about the exact placement of the heading in the HTML structure, right now it is directly above the attachments list - does that look right?&lt;br /&gt;

Does anyone know if this issue going to be addressed and fixed in the next version of WP or is it something that has to be addressed by the Web Host?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thanks&lt;br /&gt;

Your best bet is getting it fixed by the web host.&lt;br /&gt;

Replying to &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/43992#comment:45" title="Comment 45"&gt;SergeyBiryukov&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'd like to see specific error messages for not meeting minimum WP version requirement vs. PHP version, rather than "WordPress and/or PHP". &lt;code&gt;validate_plugin_requirements()&lt;/code&gt; could return &lt;code&gt;WP_Error&lt;/code&gt; on error, I agree with @TimothyBlynJacobs in &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/43992#comment:33" title="Comment 33"&gt;comment:33&lt;/a&gt; here. That can probably be adjusted after beta though.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It was my plan to fix this during beta. Do you want me to try and do it before commit?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Introducing &lt;code&gt;wp_is_*_compatible()&lt;/code&gt; wrappers doesn't seem to bring a huge benefit at a glance, as there are only two or three of these checks in core. Maybe it will be easier to see once the other instances are updated to use the wrappers. I agree they should be prefixed with &lt;code&gt;wp_&lt;/code&gt;, just in case.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Search core for &lt;code&gt;$compatible_wp&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;$compatible_php&lt;/code&gt;. It will also become most beneficial if/when the decision is made to require the &lt;code&gt;Requires at least&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Requires PHP&lt;/code&gt; headers in the readme. Then all plugin will be appropriately tested as opposed to allowing those without the headers to pass on through as valid.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Looks good otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Oh, one alternative to adding &lt;code&gt;_l()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;_le()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;_l_esc_html()&lt;/code&gt; etc would be to add an extra parameter onto existing translation functions that indicates to translate lazily (eg &lt;code&gt;__($text, $text_domain =‘’ , $lazy = false)&lt;/code&gt;). No new translation functions, and we keep the number of them from growing exponentially.&lt;br /&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I can confirm that adding such might improve performance on many plugins.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let's take imagify for example (with 100000 attachment in database).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Query:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;SELECT SQL_NO_CACHE count(1)
FROM wp_posts AS p
INNER JOIN wp_postmeta AS imrwpmt1
ON ( p.ID = imrwpmt1.post_id
AND imrwpmt1.meta_key = '_wp_attached_file' )
INNER JOIN wp_postmeta AS imrwpmt2
ON ( p.ID = imrwpmt2.post_id
AND imrwpmt2.meta_key = '_wp_attachment_metadata' )
INNER JOIN wp_postmeta AS mt1
ON ( p.ID = mt1.post_id
AND mt1.meta_key = '_imagify_status' )
WHERE p.post_mime_type IN ( 'image/jpeg','image/png','image/gif','application/pdf' )
AND p.post_type = 'attachment'
AND p.post_status IN ( 'inherit','private' )
AND mt1.meta_value IN ( 'success', 'already_optimized' )
AND imrwpmt1.meta_value NOT LIKE '%://%'
AND imrwpmt1.meta_value NOT LIKE '_:\\\%'
AND ( LOWER( imrwpmt1.meta_value ) LIKE '%.jpg'
OR LOWER( imrwpmt1.meta_value ) LIKE '%.jpeg'
OR LOWER( imrwpmt1.meta_value ) LIKE '%.jpe'
OR LOWER( imrwpmt1.meta_value ) LIKE '%.png'
OR LOWER( imrwpmt1.meta_value ) LIKE '%.gif'
OR LOWER( imrwpmt1.meta_value ) LIKE '%.pdf' );
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
a) default wordpress indexes: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;1 row in set (28.22 sec)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
b) after adding post_id + meta_key index&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;ALTER TABLE wp_postmeta ADD INDEX( `post_id`, `meta_key`);
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;1 row in set (2.51 sec)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It could be 10 times faster in some situations.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Does anyone know if this issue going to be addressed and fixed in the next version of WP or is it something that has to be addressed by the Web Host?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thanks&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The top image is the current icon color, which does not have enough contrast.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The middle image uses &lt;code&gt;#6C7781&lt;/code&gt;, which is the lightest grey in our palette that passes at AA.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The bottom image uses standard link blue.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Background: &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/35497" title="#35497: defect (bug): List tables: Post format links improvements (closed: fixed)"&gt;#35497&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As a follow-up to &lt;a class="changeset" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/44961" title="Accessibility: Remove post format filter links from format icons in ..."&gt;[44961]&lt;/a&gt;, based on the feedback from &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RQBWTW/p1553183118724000"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;Slack discussion&lt;/a&gt;, a few further adjustments should be made to post format icons in the Posts list table:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Color contrast for the icons should be improved, it's too low at the moment.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;CSS transition effect on the icons should be removed.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Note: These icons are also used in the Formats meta box in the Classic Editor. However, there is also some text, and the icons are only used as a decorative element. In the post list, they are the only indication of the format (without text), so should have the appropriate contrast.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Hello, &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When we plan to publish a post, the hour is wrong localized.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a style="padding:0; border:none" href="http://i.imgur.com/LlA9cJu.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://i.imgur.com/LlA9cJu.png" alt="http://i.imgur.com/LlA9cJu.png" crossorigin="anonymous" title="http://i.imgur.com/LlA9cJu.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On this French Screenshot, the post is plan for the 23rd of March at 5.30pm (17h30)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here, it's OK:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a style="padding:0; border:none" href="https://i.imgur.com/Hq1qrPy.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.imgur.com/Hq1qrPy.png" alt="https://i.imgur.com/Hq1qrPy.png" crossorigin="anonymous" title="https://i.imgur.com/Hq1qrPy.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
but here, it means 5:30 am and not 5:30pm&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a style="padding:0; border:none" href="https://i.imgur.com/fmW4ll9.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.imgur.com/fmW4ll9.png" alt="https://i.imgur.com/fmW4ll9.png" crossorigin="anonymous" title="https://i.imgur.com/fmW4ll9.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
@afercia You're right. We should use the same behaviour as post_content. I'll try to have a patch ready in the next few hours. Otherwise, we should punt it to the next release.&lt;br /&gt;

      <title>Ticket #46589 (Backslashes being doubled in text block) created</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I am having an issue within WordPress which it seems to be doubling the \ within a file directory\path within a text block.&lt;br /&gt;
For example, I have a directory or file path for someone to copy and paste, for example:&lt;br /&gt;
           &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
C:\Program Files\MagicDraw\Plugins\(your downloaded Plugin)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
         &lt;br /&gt;
Gets changed to:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
C:&lt;br /&gt;Program Files&lt;br /&gt;MagicDraw&lt;br /&gt;Plugins&lt;br /&gt;(your downloaded Plugin)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I have tried using the raw tag to try to keep the address raw text, shown below. But it seems to keep reverting back to the doubled \ state. &lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;!--raw--&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;C:&lt;br /&gt;Program Files\MagicDraw\Plugins\(your downloaded Plugin)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;!--/raw--&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Additionally, I have not been able to determine the trigger for this either. It seems to happen randomly. I have tried opening the page in a new tab, closing all browser windows and revisiting the page, but still remains in the corrected state. It has been happening on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I think we should change the capability check on this. &lt;code&gt;manage_options&lt;/code&gt; works well for single sites, but I don't think that works for the majority of multisite environment setups. In a network, single-site admins would not be able to take action on really any of these recommendations. For example, updating core or uninstalling themes/plugins would both have to be done by a network admin. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Should we adjust it to something like &lt;code&gt;update_core&lt;/code&gt;, or add some type of exception for multisite?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

In &lt;a class="changeset" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/44962" title="Bootstrap/Load: Introduce fatal error handler.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="message"&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Bootstrap/Load: Introduce fatal error handler.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This changeset introduces a &lt;code&gt;WP_Fatal_Error_Handler&lt;/code&gt; class that detects fatal errors and displays a more user-friendly message about the site experiencing technical difficulties.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Websites that have custom requirements in that regard can implement their own fatal error handler by adding a &lt;code&gt;fatal-error-handler.php&lt;/code&gt; drop-in that returns the handler instance to use, which must be based on a class that inherits &lt;code&gt;WP_Fatal_Error_Handler&lt;/code&gt;. That handler will then be used in place of the default one. Alternatively, the fatal error handler feature can be completely disable through a constant &lt;code&gt;WP_DISABLE_FATAL_ERROR_HANDLER&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Websites that would like to modify specifically the error template displayed in the frontend can add a &lt;code&gt;php-error.php&lt;/code&gt; drop-in that works similarly to the existing &lt;code&gt;db-error.php&lt;/code&gt; drop-in. For more granular customization, the fatal error handler also includes new filters &lt;code&gt;wp_should_handle_php_error&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;wp_php_error_message&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;wp_php_error_args&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;

      <title>Ticket #46588 (comment-reply JavaScript not working with comments loaded via Ajax) created</title>

      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/46588/1553182843762056</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
When loading comments via Ajax, the 'Reply' button &lt;code&gt;comment-reply.js&lt;/code&gt; does not trigger on the newly added comments. This causes a link action to be performed rather than moving the reply box to the desired position.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I also noticed in the &lt;code&gt;get_comment_reply_link&lt;/code&gt; method of &lt;code&gt;includes/comment-template.php&lt;/code&gt; that the comment reply link is the admin-ajax or REST API endpoint URL rather than the actual page URL with &lt;code&gt;?replytocom=13#respond&lt;/code&gt; appended.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It will not make WP sites more secure&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Explain how.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Because it simultaneously provides a mechanism for evading the CSP entirely.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hypothetical:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Plugin Developer A writes a plugin that templates JavaScript. To do this he uses the proposed function to generate nonces. However, the way the JavaScript in question is templated by the PHP of his plugin changes depending on user input and the developer fails to properly sanitize that input (this is a bog standard XSS scenario).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Without this patch the site operator would have to configure a CSP with unsafe-inline. The user and the user's client could therefore be warned of the risk of XSS when using said plugin. As CSP is adopted more and more eventually Google, Mozilla, Microsoft, Apple and the rest of the browser developers could add unsafe-inline to the warnings shown in the address bar specifically to let users know when they are at risk of having their personally identifiable information exposed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With this patch, however, a malicious user could input specially formatted PHP code into the poorly sanitized inputs with the intent of injecting XSS JavaScript in the associated output, and your proposed patch would ensure that the user and the user's browser was told that this XSS JS code is trustworthy. And, as CSP is adopted more and more... when browser developers make the switch to warning users WordPress sites will be lying to the user about their level of risk.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
CSP is designed specifically to reduce the risk to end users from poorly sanitized inputs and unintended connections between user input and html/css/js output. But if you go marking all of that output as trusted without knowing &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; what that output will be... then CSP can't work. How is that not obvious?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It doesn't matter if the &lt;em&gt;exploitable code&lt;/em&gt; is in the JS itself or the PHP behind it. The reason inline JS is unsafe is exactly because there's no way to tell what inline JS is intended to be there and what inline JS is the &lt;em&gt;result&lt;/em&gt; of an exploit. If inline JS is disallowed entirely then any inline JS is &lt;em&gt;obviously&lt;/em&gt; not supposed to be there. The use of nonces to mark inline JS as safe is intended for use with carefully vetted, _&lt;em&gt;static&lt;/em&gt;_ JavaScript.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But with your patch &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; inline JS templated via PHP will get marked as "supposed to be there" before being sent to the user... meaning that there is still no way to tell what inline JS is actually supposed to be there and what isn't. If the PHP turns out to be exploitable then malicious JS can be marked as trusted. This is functionally identical to using unsafe-inline in the CSP to begin with... except, again, the user isn't made aware of the issue.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'm aware of just what a gargantuan task it would be to convert WordPress to use static JavaScript separated from the html. ::shrug:: That's what happens when you find yourself managing an application or system that defies best practices. Maybe it wasn't best practice five years ago... cry me a river. As a site operator my responsibility is to my users. Not WordPress. And one of the objectives of CSP adoption is to force software developers to stop using unsafe practices. Refactor WordPress... leave the plugin developers to justify doing otherwise to their users.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Or don't. Go ahead and make it official that WordPress requires running with unsafe-inline and the totally-not-a-problem isn't going to be solved. Hell, I'll even update the documentation myself. But this patch, well intentioned or not, is categorically The Wrong Way from a security standpoint.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Bottom line is bottom line: this patch is identical in security risk to running with unsafe-inline &lt;strong&gt;except that it hides the problem&lt;/strong&gt;. And no one in this thread can say they weren't warned.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
For consistency with images added in the post content, I'd think the behavior should be different.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the post content, images get &lt;code&gt;noopener noreferrer&lt;/code&gt; even if users set their own value. Also, when reopening the details modal, the "rel" field is populated with &lt;code&gt;noopener noreferrer&lt;/code&gt; plus any custom value previously added:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a style="padding:0; border:none" href="http://cldup.com/3gBfUq6uDV.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://cldup.com/3gBfUq6uDV.png" alt="http://cldup.com/3gBfUq6uDV.png" crossorigin="anonymous" title="http://cldup.com/3gBfUq6uDV.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Instead, with this patch &lt;code&gt;noopener noreferrer&lt;/code&gt; are added only if the field is empty. Also, when reopening the details modal the field is empty.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #35497 (List tables: Post format links improvements) updated</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Adding a Formats dropdown filter is a great enhancement. However, I think keeping the icons in the post list as a simple visual indicator also has some benefit, otherwise there's no way to quickly distinguish posts with a format from standard posts. It also seems more consistent with the Formats meta box still available in the Classic Editor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since the main purpose of the ticket is removing the links from these icons (rather than removing the icons themselves), I'm inclined to do just that, while keeping the same visual appearance for now. From reading the comments and the Slack discussion in #design linked above, it looks like there are no objections to that.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If the icons should be removed as a part of a redesign at some point, a new ticket can be opened for that.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

@ianbelanger @earnjam @wpscholar and myself are working through some of these patch issues on a &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/earnjam/wordpress-develop/tree/site-health-check"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;branch in the wordpress-develop fork&lt;/a&gt; to prevent conflicts while patching.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Tackled so far:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ran &lt;code&gt;composer run format&lt;/code&gt; to correct coding standards issues on the patch.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We don't need to check defined( 'ABSPATH' ) at the top of each file.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All of the esc_html&lt;span class="underline"&gt;() and esc_html_e() calls should be replaced with &lt;/span&gt;() and _e(), respectively. We perform appropriate safety checks on strings in GlotPress, instead.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The PHP and MySQL versions in WP_Site_Health need to be bumped to 5.6 and 5.5, respectively.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

@antpb thanks for sharing the team feedback. I'm not sure there's anything that needs a decision here. Building the tool and actually using it are 2 different phases:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;phase 1: we need a reusable heading view, and this ticket is waiting since 3 years
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;phase 2: once we have the tool, we'll take care of using it where necessary in the media views: this can be done in the next releases
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I think they go largely unused. And to be honest, in the case I ran into it was only used to deal with some nuances of Gutenberg rather than for adding functionality.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I am not experienced with Angular but it apparently can be used to prevent full page reloads for Angular apps. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It's also interesting to see that the HTML specs allow for other values as well:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html53/browsers.html#browsing-context-name"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://www.w3.org/TR/html53/browsers.html#browsing-context-name&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Hello! This ticket was discussed in the recent Media meeting and I think we are still deciding the full scope of the task. If that is true, we may need to punt to 5.3 for the sake of the timing of 5.2. @adamsilverstein how do you feel about that? Do you think there are any pieces of this that can land with future task to finish it out?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;i&gt;Keywords&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Thank you for wrangling this patch, @Clorith! My apologies for reviewing it so late in the process. I think we're generally heading in the right direction, but there is some work to be done still. Some of it should probably be done before beta 1, but a lot of it can be put off until after then.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Generally speaking, the biggest issue I ran into was the lack of comments. Both docblocks and inline comments explaining some of the trickier code would've helped a lot.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the JavaScript:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I noticed quite a few coding standards issues. Linting it should help.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is there a particular reason why things are split into multiple &lt;code&gt;jQuery.ready()&lt;/code&gt; calls?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Because everything is scoped inside &lt;code&gt;jQuery.ready()&lt;/code&gt; calls, here's no need for the &lt;code&gt;HC&lt;/code&gt; prefix in function names.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm not wild about the HTML template in &lt;code&gt;HCAppendIssue()&lt;/code&gt; being generated as a string. Could this be done in a more reusable manner?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It feels like a lot of the error condition checking in &lt;code&gt;HCRecalculateProgression()&lt;/code&gt; is redundant, as the calculations should be taking care of weird values.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
For the CSS:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A lot of these rules seem like there should be equivalent versions already in Core, they're fairly generic.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Several of the colours don't match those in the &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://make.wordpress.org/design/handbook/design-guide/foundations/colors/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;Design Handbook&lt;/a&gt;. Could you double check them all?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I seem to recall &lt;code&gt;flex&lt;/code&gt; layouts being a bit janky in IE11. Could you test that it works correctly?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Into the PHP:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm a bit nervous about the magic Ajax calls which correspond to particular method names. This seems like it could be better done using actions. As we're exposing a lot of sensitive information through these calls, the less magic involved, the better.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We don't need to check &lt;code&gt;defined( 'ABSPATH' )&lt;/code&gt; at the top of each file.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All of the &lt;code&gt;esc_html__()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;esc_html_e()&lt;/code&gt; calls should be replaced with &lt;code&gt;__()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;_e()&lt;/code&gt;, respectively. We perform appropriate safety checks on strings in GlotPress, instead.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The PHP and MySQL versions in &lt;code&gt;WP_Site_Health&lt;/code&gt; need to be bumped to 5.6 and 5.5, respectively.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This is just written from a code read-through, I skipped auditing each of the tests, but that would be a good thing to spend time on. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;i&gt;Milestone&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
With the deadline being reached, we will need to punt this to 5.3. The work here is VERY close. All that is remaining is the deprecation mentioned above which the Media team has determined to be in the scope of this task.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

In the recent Media meeting, we discussed this ticket and determined since the approach is still being discussed on how to move forward, we will be moving this out of the 5.2 milestone and into 5.3. Happy to move this back if anyone has a proposed patch. &lt;br /&gt;

        <dc:creator>mdirickxwtd</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2019 13:35:24 GMT</pubDate>

      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/46587/1553175324501287</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
WP list table ignores values set in wp_siteurl and returns wrong links. This is disastrous in case of reverse proxies.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This tracked the problem to line 798 and 1082 in wp-admin/includes/class-wp-list-table.php which to me seemed to ignore the wp_siteurl settings:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$current_url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;set_url_scheme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'http://'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$_SERVER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'HTTP_HOST'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$_SERVER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'REQUEST_URI'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Changing it to&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$current_url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;set_url_scheme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;wp_guess_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$_SERVER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'REQUEST_URI'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
seemed to resolve the issue (on my end). Not sure if this a decent approach though, I'm not familiar to wp code. There might be more logic going on afterwards. I just needed something quick and dirty that works.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Background info&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'm running into this issue as I have a reverse proxy in front of my site. The reverse proxy is accessible at &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://wiki.example.com"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://wiki.example.com&lt;/a&gt;, the actual site is at &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://int.ern.al.IP/wiki"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://int.ern.al.IP/wiki&lt;/a&gt;. With the current approach, a lot of links are structured as &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://int.ern.al.IP/wiki/wp"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://int.ern.al.IP/wiki/wp&lt;/a&gt;-... which breaks the site.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

It will not make WP sites more secure&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Explain how. tbh it seems to me like you're making perfect the enemy of good.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Most XSS vulnerabilities in WordPress plugins are _not_ found inside SCRIPT tags. So by using CSP nonces we'll be preventing the majority of XSS vulnerabilities.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I agree it would be best to load all JS from &lt;code&gt;.js&lt;/code&gt; files and not use any inline JS, but that's a gargantuan task for WordPress (and forget about convincing plugin devs to do the same). I opened this ticket as a compromise which is a much easier sell (to WordPress devs and to plugin devs) while still preventing the majority of XSS vulnerabilities found in plugins.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Replying to &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12563#comment:63" title="Comment 63"&gt;apedog&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I've just read through this entire thread and am frankly baffled. I'm used to seeing discussion thread around feature requests on different repositories. And quite a few where the project leads refuse those feature requests on ideological and design philosophy grounds. Even if those leads accept that the feature might be useful to a portion of the users.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But this is not the case here. The feature is rejected without any cogent reason. 'WordPress has survived for 8 years without this useful feature' is given as a valid reason. 'GMT hooking into body tag will soon be a thing of the past' - another reply. 'Themes will not adopt this' was one very un-forward-looking argument given (the recent push of Gutenberg being a clear example to the contrary - plugin developers have rushed to implement). And finally - 'Gutenberg is coming and it's gonna change EVERYTHING'. While the last might be true, it is irrelevant to the necessity of this hook. This has nothing to do with Gutenberg or with themes, and all to do with plugins that require hooking into the opening of the BODY tag.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I absolutely agree, 100%.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We are working with tools like Google Tag Manager for numerous clients and not having this feature has given us headaches for years.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We need to insert specific code *right after* the opening &amp;lt;body&amp;gt; tag.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Without other code - be it from templates, plugins, hooks or whatever - in between.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Also not in the header, not in the footer and not at the end of the header.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And most certainly not called late by get_header or something similar.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Looking forward... Can it be done?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Replying to &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16841#comment:60" title="Comment 60"&gt;Mte90&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This snippet seems to have fixed the issue I was facing.&lt;br /&gt;
I use the "Super Socializer" plugin to create new users via Facebook login and assign them a custom role.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Until now authors showed as blank titles from the author dropdown menu.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After adding the code to my functions.php I could see author names showing in the quick edit section.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thanks for that! I hope it will get fixed in 5.2.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To fix in your instance you have to run this piece of code and use the user role that you want.&lt;br /&gt;
After reading on Slack the problem is that usually usuers created manually (instead of registration screen) doesn't have this user_level configured.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Anyway in case your issue is different you can fix it running this code but you have to do it everytime until there is a fix for this problem.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Also this problem happen in REST API so this fix the problem also in Gutenberg.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;$blogusers = get_users( 'role=instructor' );
foreach ( $blogusers as $user ) {
   $user-&amp;gt;add_cap('level_1');
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <description>&lt;i&gt;Keywords&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Tested the patch, LGTM&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I was wondering why the legacy widget php file was not synced automatically though.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Thanks for the ticket @heller_benjamin &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I was also wondering about this yesterday, when looking into some unit-tests for tickets that use the function.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The function was introduced in &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/43187" title="#43187: enhancement: Add pre-save filter to make target=&amp;#34;_blank&amp;#34; always secure (closed: fixed)"&gt;#43187&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I noticed that in &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/danielstjules/blankshield"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;blankshield&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;code&gt;_top&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;_self&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;_parent&lt;/code&gt; are mentioned as safe targets.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It would be nice to see some more info on that and also what are the typical use cases for these browsing contexts, after the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;frame&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;framesets&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; (but not &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;iframe&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;) have been &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html53/obsolete.html#elementdef-frame"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;deprecated&lt;/a&gt; in HTML5. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here is some info on supported &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html53/browsers.html#browsing-context-name"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;browser contexts&lt;/a&gt; in HTML5.&lt;br /&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Oh, the "Last Checked" message.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That is stored as a site transient. If you have any caching plugins or anything like that, then that can interfere with that. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Really, that isn't stored in the database necessarily, as transients could be stored in a memcache, for instance. Having the last_checked be zero will cause the 1970 display, but it's not considered a critical value, since it's just set to the time() when the check runs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Basically, turn off all your plugins and see which of them is causing interference.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

        <dc:creator>SergeyBiryukov</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2019 10:22:37 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40666#comment:27</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40666#comment:27/1553163757036346</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Replying to &lt;a class="ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40666#comment:1" title="Comment 1"&gt;pbiron&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To the best of my knowledge,  in core &lt;code&gt;Walker_Category&lt;/code&gt; is only used by &lt;code&gt;wp_list_categories()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;wp_list_categories()&lt;/code&gt; is only used by &lt;code&gt;WP_Widget_Categories&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As a result, I'm not sure that the name of new filter introduced in my patch (&lt;code&gt;category_menu_link_attributes&lt;/code&gt;) is appropriate.  I named it that to mirror the new filter introduced in &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40359" title="#40359: enhancement: allow arbitrary HTML attributes on &amp;lt;a&amp;gt; produced by Walker_Page (closed: fixed)"&gt;#40359&lt;/a&gt;...which was named after the existing filter in &lt;code&gt;Walker_Nav_Menu&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'd like some feedback on the naming (and inline docs) for this new filter.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In hindsight, &lt;code&gt;page_menu_link_attributes&lt;/code&gt; could probably have been called &lt;code&gt;page_list_link_attributes&lt;/code&gt;, as &lt;code&gt;Walker_Page&lt;/code&gt; is only used directly in &lt;code&gt;wp_list_pages()&lt;/code&gt;, via &lt;code&gt;walk_page_tree()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
However, &lt;code&gt;wp_list_pages()&lt;/code&gt; is also used in &lt;code&gt;wp_page_menu()&lt;/code&gt;, so &lt;code&gt;page_menu_link_attributes&lt;/code&gt; seemed to make sense in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For categories, I think &lt;code&gt;category_list_link_attributes&lt;/code&gt; would make sense without deviating too much from the existing naming of &lt;code&gt;page_menu_link_attributes&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;nav_menu_link_attributes&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;determine_current_user&lt;/code&gt; filter (&lt;a class="source" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/src/wp-includes/user.php#L2698"&gt;source:trunk/src/wp-includes/user.php#L2698&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/export/HEAD/trunk/src/wp-includes/user.php#L2698" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt;) in &lt;code&gt;_wp_get_current_user()&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;a class="source" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/src/wp-includes/user.php#L2639"&gt;source:trunk/src/wp-includes/user.php#L2639&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/export/HEAD/trunk/src/wp-includes/user.php#L2639" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt;) was introduced by @nacin in &lt;a class="changeset" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/27484/trunk/src/wp-includes/pluggable.php" title="Allow for custom authentication handlers for all requests.
Turn the ..."&gt;changeset:27484/trunk/src/wp-includes/pluggable.php&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It is only run &lt;em&gt;once&lt;/em&gt; per request, i.e. if the global variable &lt;code&gt;$current_user&lt;/code&gt; is still empty. This leads to problems when a plugin calls &lt;code&gt;wp_get_current_user()&lt;/code&gt; early and other plugins that are executed later rely on the filter callback to be executed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Example (pseudo code):&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;/**
 * Plugin Name: Plugin A
 */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;add_action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'plugins_loaded'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;add_filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'determine_current_user'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$user_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Do something here with $user_id.
&lt;/span&gt;                &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// If Plugin B is active, this will never be executed.
&lt;/span&gt;                &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$user_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;wp_get_current_user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Do something here with $user.
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;/**
 * Plugin Name: Plugin B
 */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;add_action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'plugins_loaded'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;wp_get_current_user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Do something here with $user.
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
My suggestion is to either move the filter up in the function so that it is executed every time the function is called, call the filter before any &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; statements, or introduce a new filter that is executed at the beginning of the function (e.g. &lt;code&gt;pre_determine_current_user&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What do you think of that? Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #46585 (Customizer: Add Media to Menus using media manager) created</title>
      
        <dc:creator>themightyant</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2019 09:19:05 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/46585</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/46585/1553159945947442</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Currently the process of adding Media (e.g. a PDF link) to Menus in the Customizer is a poor user experience that requires several steps including changing between multiple screens. i.e.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Navigating away from the Customizer
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Copy and pasting a URL from the Media Library (which in itself is prone to human error as the box is smaller that the URL it contains)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;before navigating back to the Customizer to add a Custom Link.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It's pretty inelegant solution and one that end clients often mess up!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here's my proposal.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have a Media Library Accordion with a file button to directly access the Media Manager from within the Customizer
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JiVhZ.jpg"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://i.stack.imgur.com/JiVhZ.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It also addresses a bug where the default theme (Twenty Nineteen at this time) was being shown twice if it was your active theme, which would be confusing.&lt;br /&gt;

This is also a problem in the Customizer, when changing the Extra CSS. &lt;code&gt;grid-template-columns: 1fr;&lt;/code&gt; is not recognised.&lt;br /&gt;

Thanks @xkon &amp;amp; @birgire I greatly appreciate the testing and input. And whole-heartedly agree that differentiating the filter by naming it &lt;code&gt;users_have_additional_content&lt;/code&gt; gives it the necessary context to properly define it's behaviour.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I also appreciate the additional patches and have put a final &lt;a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/36860/36860.7.diff"&gt;36860.7.diff&lt;/a&gt; forward which removes the need for the additional variable and checks as it provides the same results/conditions and preserves the distinct and contextual filter name.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I've marked as commit, but please take a last test on it and I'll work on the docs once it's in the 5.2 beta.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Patch to cleanup the code and remove need of extra variable, but kept the contextual filter name

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I find @birgire 's comment easier to read in general as the different naming of the filter makes more sense and it also avoids the 2 extra db checks so that can't be bad as well :) .&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since I was checking this out &lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/36860/36860.6.diff" title="Attachment '36860.6.diff' in Ticket #36860"&gt;36860.6.diff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/36860/36860.6.diff" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt; is based on that while adding the &lt;code&gt;users_have_additional_content&lt;/code&gt; name for descriptive purposes. I'm pretty sure this will come in handy to more authors as well.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And since I was at it a little "copy paste" to save some time as well:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;
add_filter(
	'users_have_additional_content',
	function( $flag, $userids ) {
		if ( ! $flag ) {
			error_log( print_r( $userids, true ) );
			$flag = true;
		}
		return $flag;
	},
	15,
	2
);

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Thanks for your comment @celloexpressions &lt;br /&gt;
I don't think value is a good idea since this attribute is supposed to specifiy a default value. Placeholders should be used to specify an example value.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
By the way, I updated the patch.&lt;br /&gt;
In &lt;code&gt;46312.3.diff&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add https to both menu and customizer screens
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Replace &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;placeholder&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Updates the custom link check to handle both &lt;code&gt;http://&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;https://&lt;/code&gt; and empty value… though it should be empty all the time now we don't have any default value anymore. But… worth it :)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;
@SergeyBiryukov if you have a chance, can you please check what I say in the item 3) above in the last patch &lt;code&gt;46312.3.diff&lt;/code&gt; ?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

@Clorith , in &lt;code&gt;class-wp-site-health.php - Line 1348&lt;/code&gt; there's a check that prints out the "Test without plugins" button if the Loopback request fails. Should this button be included here? Doesn't seem like there's any action bound to it at the moment.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This adds a pure PHP implementation of the cryptographic functions supported in PHP 7.2+. It provides the necessary backwards compatibility required to support signature verification and other security features going forward across all supported PHP versions.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;i&gt;Keywords&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Milestone&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/36612/36612.2.diff" title="Attachment '36612.2.diff' in Ticket #36612"&gt;36612.2.diff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/36612/36612.2.diff" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt; still works for me. Nothing has changed since I marked this for commit 8 months ago, other than a string of punts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Theoretically, the changes to &lt;code&gt;wp-includes/class-wp-customize-manager.php&lt;/code&gt; could be omitted if this is not backported to 4.9.X; however, this change would not negatively impact the feature's ability to function. Keeping the patch as-is ensures that the adjustment should work regardless of the .org API version used.&lt;br /&gt;

      <title>Ticket #46581 ($skip_list in copy_dir function is not working as it should) created</title>
      
        <dc:creator>codex-m</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2019 03:03:22 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/46581</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/46581/1553137402606856</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;code&gt;$skip_list&lt;/code&gt; which is the third parameter of &lt;code&gt;copy_dir()&lt;/code&gt; is used to skip some folders and files from being copied with &lt;code&gt;copy_dir&lt;/code&gt;. The purpose is to reduce the total size of the copied folder.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I found this bug while attempting to write a code that uses &lt;code&gt;copy_dir()&lt;/code&gt; with $skip_list` set.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Documentation&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/copy_dir/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/copy_dir/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Issue:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Supposing I have the following &lt;code&gt;$skip_list&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;copy_dir()&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$skip_list = ['2019/03/large-folder-test'];&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When I call &lt;code&gt;copy_dir()&lt;/code&gt; with this exclusion list. The entire &lt;code&gt;/2019/&lt;/code&gt; is excluded instead of the targeted &lt;code&gt;2019/03/large-folder-test&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I debugged and its because in the &lt;code&gt;copy_dir()&lt;/code&gt;, its not using strict type check in the &lt;code&gt;in_array&lt;/code&gt; call. Thus when the filename is &lt;code&gt;2009&lt;/code&gt;, it returns &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; with a &lt;code&gt;$skip_list&lt;/code&gt; of:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$skip_list = ['2019/03/large-folder-test'];&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The debug screenshot says it all (attached on this ticket.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This issue can easily be reproduced by putting large directory to exclude deep within the uploads directory just like the screenshot. Then write a custom code with &lt;code&gt;$skip_list&lt;/code&gt; set.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Fix:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The fix is simply to add &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; to the third parameter of &lt;code&gt;in_array&lt;/code&gt;. This will ensure it will do an exact match check. I tested this and it now only excludes the folder in the skip list array.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I put the severity of this bug to major because if someone uses the third parameter of &lt;code&gt;copy_dir()&lt;/code&gt;, it will cause it to skip some crucial folders that needs to be copied.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Please review. Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Some of my testing environment just for information:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;PHP version:&lt;/em&gt; 7.2.16&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;WordPress version&lt;/em&gt; where issue is found: trunk and latest WordPress 5.1.1&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;OS&lt;/em&gt;: Ubuntu 16.04&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>wontfix: &lt;p&gt;
WordPress core and its philosophies do not generally provide user-facing settings to enable and disable features. The core customize API provides the capability to disable any feature granularly. A plugin (or theme) can call something like:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;$wp_customize-&amp;gt;remove_section( 'custom_css' );
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
And that should prevent the feature from loading. It could also de-enqueue scripts or more-deeply remove the feature. Alternatively, a plugin could reassign the &lt;code&gt;custom_css&lt;/code&gt; setting to a textarea control instead of the core code editor control. Old versions of the Modular Custom CSS plugin enabled this feature in a similarly simplified way.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Closing, as this is plugin territory. Please feel free to continue discussion in this closed ticked or on the WordPress support forums. Please also open more-specific tickets for any specific issues or potential improvements for the custom CSS feature.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

        <dc:creator>celloexpressions</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2019 02:46:09 GMT</pubDate>

      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/46312#comment:14/1553136369665082</guid>
      <description>&lt;i&gt;Keywords&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The (original) design intent of this "placeholder" is actually to be a part of a value as opposed to a true placeholder. It's provided as a staring point for users that type in a URL. Users pasting in a URL would need to manually remove this default value. I'd prefer keeping the current behavior unless research supports making a change. However, I support updating to &lt;code&gt;https://&lt;/code&gt; either way. I also recall some menu customizer JS that may be tied to the default value and that should be confirmed before making the change.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This needs to be updated both in the customizer and in the admin version of menus if a change is made, either way. It looks like we need a combination of &lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/46312/46312.2.diff" title="Attachment '46312.2.diff' in Ticket #46312"&gt;46312.2.diff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/46312/46312.2.diff" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/46312/46312-patch-https.diff" title="Attachment '46312-patch-https.diff' in Ticket #46312"&gt;46312-patch-https.diff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/46312/46312-patch-https.diff" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt; once a decision is made on changing from a default value to a placeholder. &lt;br /&gt;

Looks like I uploaded extra files because i used the &lt;code&gt;$ grunt upload_patch:41032&lt;/code&gt;command. Will need to fix that...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I modified the tests &lt;code&gt;test_rest_parse_date&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;test_rest_parse_date_force_utc&lt;/code&gt;to &lt;code&gt;assertNotFalse&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;assertEquals&lt;/code&gt; because I am getting different unix timestamps for &lt;code&gt;strtotime(...)&lt;/code&gt; used in the &lt;code&gt;rest_parse_date&lt;/code&gt; function in &lt;code&gt;wp-includes/rest-api.php&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;gmmktime(...)&lt;/code&gt; function for testing in &lt;code&gt;phpunit/tests/rest-api.php&lt;/code&gt; For instance&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
php &amp;gt; echo gmmktime( 0, 0, 0, 1, 16, 2017 );&lt;br /&gt;
1484524800&lt;br /&gt;
php &amp;gt; echo strtotime( '2017-01-16' );&lt;br /&gt;
1484542800&lt;br /&gt;
php &amp;gt; echo strtotime( '2017-01-16T' );&lt;br /&gt;
1484550000&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
are all valid strings and it is sufficient to just &lt;code&gt;assertTrue&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This also seems to respond to &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38614" title="#38614: enhancement: Text widget markup is not removable (closed: wontfix)"&gt;#38614&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Oh yes, of course. Another reason why it doesn't work is that the changeset UUID is not included in the stylesheet URL, so that is why the Customizer state is not applied to the requested stylesheet. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Since everything is in an external stylesheet, the only thing needed is to update the URL of the stylesheet, no?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I appreciate your help @westonruter, actually, the CSS is kinda dynamic (Bootstrap with &lt;strong&gt;customizable variables&lt;/strong&gt;), before knowing the CSS, I need to know the variables, then create the CSS that uses them and give the file a name that contains these variables md5 (for unicity).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I tried passing the variables using code similar to yours with AJAX in it, unhappily, the AJAX response was always -1 and I was not able to get the new CSS link using that method, from there I moved to &lt;code&gt;selective_refresh&lt;/code&gt; where I had that error with the the admin bar CSS, then finally I reverted to &lt;code&gt;refresh&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thanks again for your help, I don't want to waste your time on this, &lt;code&gt;'postMessage' =&amp;gt; 'refresh'&lt;/code&gt; works for me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
