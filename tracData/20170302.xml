Unless someone disagrees with the approach here, we'll get it committed after the 4.7.3 release ships.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I would prefer to see *everything*, especially "new" things committed to trunk for soak well in advance of 4.7.x merges, just to get extra testing of things prior to branch use - even though this is a small change, catching small discrepancies is hard if things get trunk commits delayed for any reason.
&lt;/p&gt;

I'm really not sure what many of the comments here are about, but they don't seem to be about coming up with a strategy for upgrading the minimum version of PHP.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My proposal: no later than whenever a version of PHP gets EOL'd, regardless of user share. WordPress can potentially still run on older versions of PHP, but they wouldn't be officially supported.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'm really not sure what many of the comments here are about, but they don't seem to be about coming up with a strategy for upgrading the minimum version of PHP. They aren't suggesting concrete plans for when the minimum version increases process should be triggered( Is it when we hit 1% of all sites?  0.5% of the last two major versions? something else?) or what that process should look like ( Is it a 2-year process, a 4 major release process, or something different? What are the steps of the process?).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Well, just about everything possible has probably already been proposed in very general terms. The reason why it keeps going in circles is that nothing that is suggested seems to gain any traction with core devs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
"Just do it" isn't a process and that level of hostility towards millions of users isn't something I'm comfortable with.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'm not sure anyone has really suggested that, and I think everybody applauds the fact that WordPress is putting users first. If it comes across otherwise, apologies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One thing that I think predates implementing any sort of process is coming up with some user level educational materials about 1) What PHP (and for that matter, MySQL and other server technologies) are 2) Why new versions are important and 3) How to go about upgrading. I would love to see someone step up and own the creation of that matterial.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I 100% agree. I would point out though that this is a 180° turn-around from the previous stance, which seemed to be that users should never have to know anything about this technology. So I absolutely agree that we should revisit the admin notice idea with good docs for all of this in place. Here are &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://wordpoints.org/user-guide/php-compatibility/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;some user docs regarding PHP&lt;/a&gt; that I recently wrote up for a plugin, in preparation for potentially upping the PHP version in the future. It is partly based on &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://codex.buddypress.org/getting-started/buddypress-2-8-will-require-php-5-3/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;BuddyPress's docs&lt;/a&gt;.

@jorbin Looks like we posted at around the same time. Thoughts on my previous comment? We seem to be trending on an idea. User education would be super valuable. It does risks putting outdated hosts in a bad spot because the curtain gets pulled back, but that might not be such a bad thing after all this time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A dashboard notice was considered in &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/9751" title="#9751: task (blessed): Add notice for users running PHP 4 (closed: wontfix)"&gt;#9751&lt;/a&gt; and while I was originally in favor, without a large amount of educational information (much more than could or should reasonably fit in a notice), it doesn't solve anything. It just becomes either a notice for users to ignore or if not worded really well, argumentum in terrorem.
&lt;/p&gt;

Please don't shout. I did read that. That's not what I see on a clean install, unless I'm trying to edit the main site on the network.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Which shouldn't be a question of 'mapping' because you don't map the primary domain on the network. If you're trying to map your primary domain, then that's why you can't edit it, and this is by design.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You're not supposed to change the main domain of your network unless you seriously totally 10000% know what you're doing, because you could very easily break everything.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/src/wp-admin/network/site-info.php#L161"&gt;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/src/wp-admin/network/site-info.php#L161&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Multisite can be pretty dangerous. If you change the primary domain you need to use serialization safe search/replace.
&lt;/p&gt;

It's really nice to see some revived interest here. Thanks to everyone for chiming in.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
@seancjones Some great points about user experience. This also echoes some of @jdgrimes comment. If I was part of that 2.5%, I'd would gratefully welcome someone telling me that I'm paying a web host for 10yr old defunct technology. But it would seem we're more afraid of "punishing" them. Feels like an irresponsible enablement of ignorance at the expense of progress.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
How far would one friendly dashboard notice go?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
"Hey guy, you're on a really old PHP version. You should consider asking your host to upgrade. Read this article for more info"
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That's a pretty simple place to start without punishing the users, while lighting a fire under negligent hosts.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One of WordPress's development philosophies is the 80% rule. Any feature that doesn't benefit 80% of users doesn't belong in core. While that is about user-facing features, can't we at least agree that the same type of logic really has to be applied here at some point?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Unfortunately the corollary to that is that the 20% should be able to be made up by plugin developers and themers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Right now we are holding the entirety of WordPress core hostage to 5% of users.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I assume that the 5% means the 5.2 people, right? So were basically talking about using namespaces and anonymous functions in core files? That's really the two big changes between 5.2 and 5.3 (unless you count &lt;code&gt;goto&lt;/code&gt;) and doesn't really seem to be a deal breaker to me.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All of my code targets PHP 7 unless I have a specific client request or I'm making an public plugin, so I personally want to up these numbers, too. But core's perspective is that those percentages, even if they seem small to us, actually turn into a lot of customers and those customers, in various manners, turn into dollars.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Putting a PHP version check in a plugin in activation/load (since PHP versions can change on the fly) is probably the safest and easiest thing to do.
&lt;/p&gt;

Converting to &lt;code&gt;0(int)&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;"0"(string)&lt;/code&gt; will result in a database write on every call, as all options are recorded as strings. The old and new value comparison becomes &lt;code&gt;0 === "0"&lt;/code&gt; and evaluates to false. (related &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38903" title="#38903: defect (bug): Prevent `update_option()` from updating when the old and new values ... (closed: fixed)"&gt;#38903&lt;/a&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A more robust solution would be to correctly cast the value before comparing old an new values.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It's worth noting &lt;code&gt;add_option()&lt;/code&gt; will fail to store the value &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; too. &lt;a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/4.7.2/src/wp-includes/option.php?marks=410-411#L410"&gt;ref&lt;/a&gt;.

Speaking of WordPress philosophies, I've had a thought on this that I've declined to voice up until now, but here it goes. One of WordPress's development philosophies is the 80% rule. Any feature that doesn't benefit 80% of users doesn't belong in core. While that is about user-facing features, can't we at least agree that the same type of logic really has to be applied here at some point? Right now we are holding the entirety of WordPress core hostage to 5% of users. Putting in so much effort to please a small number of users is silly, which is why the 80% rule exists. I think that if the average user knew that WordPress was putting a large amount of effort into not breaking 3% of user's sites, rather than building new features or fixing real bugs, they would be disgusted. Sure, everyone is pleased that we want the best for users, but building WordPress 20.5 to run on a PHP version that 5 sites are still hanging onto is ridiculous. Obviously, that isn't something that anybody is suggesting should happen here. The question this ticket is trying to resolve though, is what exactly &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; going to happen? And until there is an actual discussion where the core devs are helping develop a strategy instead of saying  "not yet", many developers are going to remain frustrated. As pointed out above, if WordPress doesn't lead on this, forcing plugin authors to take the initiative, the developer community is going to fragment, and as a result UX is going to be degraded.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So OK, maybe we're not going to come up with a 95% rule for PHP versions. Maybe we want to be more pragmatic here (and that's probably good). But it is very frustrating when there is no end in sight, when there doesn't even appear to be any desire to even begin the process of preparing to prepare core for this. For all we know, WordPress 20.5 &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; still support PHP 5.2, because there seem to be no plans whatsoever to strategize actually updating the PHP version someday. It is almost as if we are hoping to ignore the problem and then it will go away. We know that isn't the intention, and that the goal is doing what is best for users. But we'd like some of the core devs to reconsider whether this is still the best thing for users at this point, or at what point continuing to support outdated PHP versions is no longer going to be the best thing for users. At some point it isn't anymore. I think everyone agrees on that. Somehow though, we're able to disagree about whether we should talk about when that point is, and how to prepare for it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Huh, when put that way, it is actually kind of humorous. :-)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Actually though, after considering the recent replies to this ticket, a sort of strategy has been outlined, though it needs some polish:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wait.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Let plugins do the legwork.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At some point, as yet undetermined, up core's requirement.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Others have already objected to different parts of this strategy, so I won't bother with that. I will say though, that if this is the way that we are going to go, then WordPress should encourage it by reducing pain for users as plugins start becoming incompatible. Otherwise this is pretty certainly &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the best experience for users. &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/23880" title="#23880: feature request: Minimum PHP version in Plugins (closed: duplicate)"&gt;#23880&lt;/a&gt; would seem to be a must.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Also, even given that, it still doesn't invalidate the point of this ticket. WordPress core will still need to prepare to update, and still need to come up with some idea of when it will do that (IMO).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Finally, I'd like to echo @fightthecurrent's reply to @johnbillion: we should also be strategizing when and how to EOL WordPress 3.7. The 80%-rule type logic applies there too. Backporting indefinitely risks bringing the development of new features to a complete halt. Not in the best interest of users. At some point we have to stop rewarding irresponsible users at the expense of responsible ones. It is just wrong. OK, they are really just ignorant. Then educate them. If they don't take action, then they are definitely irresponsible. Being irresponsible means that bad things happen sometimes. Like your site getting hacked. As others have said, it is called life. This isn't being callous, it is seeing a problem that will eventually place a drag on the entire project, and taking the initiative to inform the affected users so they can fix it.
&lt;/p&gt;

        <dc:creator>nickkeenan</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Thu, 02 Mar 2017 20:45:28 GMT</pubDate>

      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40020/1488487528241448</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Steps to Reproduce:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
1) Using Safari (10.0.3, possibly other recent versions)
2) Plugins disabled, using TwentySeventeen theme, and WP 4.7.2
3) This is a site where the &lt;strong&gt;home&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;siteurl&lt;/strong&gt; slightly differ.  home is &lt;strong&gt;domain.com&lt;/strong&gt;, and siteurl is &lt;strong&gt;domain.com/wp&lt;/strong&gt;.
3) Open the Customizer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Result: Blank Customizer Frame, with console errors:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
[Error] Multiple 'X-Frame-Options' headers with conflicting values ('ALLOW-FROM &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://archetype.gameflow.design/wp/wp-admin/customize.php"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://archetype.gameflow.design/wp/wp-admin/customize.php&lt;/a&gt;, SAMEORIGIN') encountered when loading '&lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://domain.com/?customize_changeset_uuid={{INSERT-UUID-HERE}}&amp;amp;customize_theme=twentyseventeen&amp;amp;customize_messenger_channel=preview-0"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://domain.com/?customize_changeset_uuid={{INSERT-UUID-HERE}}&amp;amp;customize_theme=twentyseventeen&amp;amp;customize_messenger_channel=preview-0&lt;/a&gt;'. Falling back to 'DENY'.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
[Error] Refused to display '&lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://archetype.gameflow.design/?customize_changeset_uuid={{INSERT-UUID-HERE}}&amp;amp;customize_theme=twentyseventeen&amp;amp;customize_messenger_channel=preview-0"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://archetype.gameflow.design/?customize_changeset_uuid={{INSERT-UUID-HERE}}&amp;amp;customize_theme=twentyseventeen&amp;amp;customize_messenger_channel=preview-0&lt;/a&gt;' in a frame because it set 'X-Frame-Options' to 'ALLOW-FROM &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://archetype.gameflow.design/wp/wp-admin/customize.php"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://archetype.gameflow.design/wp/wp-admin/customize.php&lt;/a&gt;, SAMEORIGIN'.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Potential Cause:
There are conflicting X-Frame-Headers which fallback to DENY in Safari 10.0.3.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;wp-includes/class-wp-customize-manager.php&lt;/code&gt; line 1599:
&lt;code&gt;public function filter_iframe_security_headers( $headers )&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Conflicts with
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;wp-includes/functions.php&lt;/code&gt; line 5017:
&lt;code&gt;function send_frame_options_header()&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Which is loaded on &lt;code&gt;default-filters.php&lt;/code&gt; on either &lt;code&gt;login_init&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;admin_init&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

I'm not sure how it happened, but the Post ID for a standard Post was used as the value for custom_css_post_id in the theme-mods_themename option. Even though it is not a Custom CSS Post, it's content was filtered and returned as if it were.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
As I mentioned in the audio ticket (&lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39995" title="#39995: enhancement: Introduce Core Widget: Audio (closed: fixed)"&gt;#39995&lt;/a&gt;), the widget would ideally handle both a locally hosted video file along with videos from major hosting platforms like YouTube, Vimeo, and VideoPress. One this is split into a standalone widget, we should evaluate whether it makes sense to handle embedding from third-parties in v1 or wait for a v2.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There's been previous exploration into embedding from third-party video services in &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38172" title="#38172: task (blessed): Enable Video Headers in Custom Headers (closed: fixed)"&gt;#38172&lt;/a&gt;.

Wanted to mention a proof-of-concept plugin along these lines: &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/Blobfolio/svgeez"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://github.com/Blobfolio/svgeez&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
@drrobotnik KSES is not fully XML-compliant nor extensible in the right ways to make it work with SVG. SVGeez employs DOMDocument-based parsing for environments supporting it, and a KSES-like fallback for those that don't.

Worth noting the REST API response return by default &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the fields, even the ones that in this case are not needed,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is a very good point, and something we are discussing supporting directly in &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38131" title="#38131: enhancement: REST API: Provide interface to include or exclude specific fields from ... (closed: fixed)"&gt;#38131&lt;/a&gt;.  In the meantime, we could address the issue here using a filter (&lt;code&gt;rest_prepare_post_tag&lt;/code&gt;?) to reduce the returned fields to only those that we need.

The fix is simply to override any existing HTTP status with &lt;code&gt;200&lt;/code&gt; in the handler for partial refresh requests.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
When a partial refresh request is made, if the response has an error code the partial will invoke its fall back behavior, normally resulting in a full refresh. A 404 status is considered an error code by the selective refresh JS, and so this means that attempting selective refresh on the 404 template will currently always result in the fallback behavior ensuing.

&lt;p&gt;
how is dropping support a nightmare compared doing the backports to this 6/3/2 year old dead version of php? dropping support is to stop doing the fixes beyond 3.7 and version X for php.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
@fightthecurrent said it nicely: EOL is A-OK.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We don't even need to drop back compatibility for fixes, necessarily. It's more a matter of how this gets implemented and the policies surrounding it. If there is a larger issue about back compatibility becoming difficult, that's a separate can of worms, and, IMO, is not directly related to this. That process can either be revised or improved, and will be an issue if kept as-is, regardless or this decision. Likewise, it might be able to be made easier to backport to 3.7 and that could be the case regardless of a change in PHP version. I do not think the two issues should be conflated based on comments here.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #40017 (wp_get_image_mime() returns 'application/octet-stream' for non-image files.) created</title>
      
        <dc:creator>blobfolio</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Thu, 02 Mar 2017 18:20:30 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40017</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40017/1488478830584392</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
In the newly-added function &lt;code&gt;wp_get_image_mime()&lt;/code&gt;, the following line should be split into two parts:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$mime&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;image_type_to_mime_type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;exif_imagetype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$file&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;exif_imagetype()&lt;/code&gt; will return &lt;code&gt;FALSE&lt;/code&gt; on failure.
&lt;code&gt;image_type_to_mime_type()&lt;/code&gt; will cast &lt;code&gt;FALSE&lt;/code&gt; as an integer, resulting in a response of "application/octet-stream" even for invalid files.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Some EXIF types &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; "application/octet-stream", so to differentiate between failures and merely strange formats, it would be better written like:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;is_callable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'exif_imagetype'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$exif_type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;exif_imagetype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$file&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$mime&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;image_type_to_mime_type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$exif_type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

What would happen to them? nothing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The "nothing" here is significant. Increasing the minimum required version of PHP would potentially result in hundreds of thousands of sites being "orphaned" on old versions of WordPress,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
sorry to say this, but that's the actual reality. not sure about the numbers, but there's a good bunch of wordpress sites lost in the wild with no updates. Pandering to these sleeping beauties makes no sense to me. Its to the "updated wordpress+old php" that need attention.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
and the project would be left with a security fix back-compat nightmare which is worse than it is now (security fixes are currently backported to 3.7 when appropriate and it's becoming more difficult with every new release).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Plugins and Themes can require a higher version of PHP than what WordPress does. You do not have to support an outdated version of PHP or outdated install of WordPress&lt;/strong&gt; - I don't support anything older than PHP 5.4 and WordPress 4.4 at present, that's a choice I've made, and every time someone contacts me (at least once a week) asking why the plugin doesn't work for them, I explain that the detailed error message meant they need to contact their host, you can do that too.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are a few different points of view here. Mine is that I 100% agree that users should come first - it's an awesome thing about WordPress. I love it, and it's what's made it so popular.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Where I disagree with you is that what you're describing is a good user experience.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Imagine for one second:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;PHP 5.2.* user and 5.3.* user does not understand what PHP is, and just wants a website. Installs WordPress. Is very excited!
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wants &lt;strong&gt;Tumblr Importer&lt;/strong&gt;. Is really excited to get images from Tumblr on their website.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Plugin doesn't work. They get a detailed message explaining why it doesn't work, which they may or may not read/understand.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Putting myself in this user's shoes, if this happened for multiple plugins or themes, I would get frustrated. To make matters worse, each plugin developer has a different approach to handling this as there is no core solution in WordPress for declaring a PHP minimum version. This results in a truly terrible and confusing WordPress experience for the least technical people.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I am not saying raising the PHP minimum version is the only answer. I am saying that it feels pretty obvious to me that we can do a lot better as a community to help users with outdated versions of PHP figure out why their WordPress install is running like a 1989 Chevy Nova without an oil change, and getting worse every day. This is one approach, &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/23880" title="#23880: feature request: Minimum PHP version in Plugins (closed: duplicate)"&gt;#23880&lt;/a&gt; is another.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The arguments against doing something are compelling, but they assume that the only steps that can be taken would hurt the user experience and not help improve a bad one. It would be really nice if we could change the dialog to: How can we make the user experience better, supporting WordPress' core mission, while also addressing this PHP version issue in a constructive, conservative, and incremental way?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And in a quick response to @johnbillion:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
the project would be left with a security fix back-compat nightmare which is worse than it is now (security fixes are currently backported to 3.7 when appropriate and it's becoming more difficult with every new release).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If it's already more difficult with every new release, is there a way to review this separate concern and apply those systems and structures to any upgrade decision? If you're already telling me that back-compat is tough, the status quo is going to become untenable in the future. Saying that is the reason not to upgrade PHP doesn't feel quite right to me.
&lt;/p&gt;

I'll use a sweeping generalization here: every other open source project does this. And it's ok. Declaring EOL is a natural, healthy part of releasing software.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
and the project would be left with a security fix back-compat nightmare which is worse than it is now (security fixes are currently backported to 3.7 when appropriate and it's becoming more difficult with every new release).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Just like PHP has an EOL, WordPress can do the same. It's up to the user to keep their software up to date. Software is like food: if it sits for too long, it goes bad. The burden of responsibility lies on the user to clean out their fridge, not WordPress.
&lt;/p&gt;

What would happen to them? nothing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The "nothing" here is significant. Increasing the minimum required version of PHP would potentially result in hundreds of thousands of sites being "orphaned" on old versions of WordPress, and the project would be left with a security fix back-compat nightmare which is worse than it is now (security fixes are currently backported to 3.7 when appropriate and it's becoming more difficult with every new release).
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Hi everyone!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One of the things i find weird is that some are suggesting that dropping support for dangerously old php versions is going against users.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What would happen to them? nothing. At worst, these sites using php 5.2/3/4 and old wordpress versions will stay the same. If using latest version, they either upgrade php and wordpress or do nothing. Its their decision.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Why is WordPress banking the debt for this? Are there any other open source projects that take this responsibility? All i see is: update or you're on your own.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And what is being suggested here is: for those wp sites that are updated but using old php version, create a plan/documentation/support for them to upgrade. Its for their own good.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Yeah that sounds about right. It's hard to explain this one. I think it's important we allow multiple terms with same names under different parents. I'm not sure how we'd fix this in our API if it were disallowed :)
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Exactly. Given enormous popularity of WordPress and thus scale of such migration, probably everyone is fully aware that it won't be matter of one month - let it be even a year (or more if it's justified), but apparently it can't be stressed enough - &lt;em&gt;let's come up with a plan&lt;/em&gt;. A scheudle. Declare PHP 5.2 version share which is acceptable for you, if you're uncomfortable with blindly sticking to a date. Anything what can actually be discussed and we could reasonably respond to.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Repeating that it's &lt;em&gt;"too early"&lt;/em&gt; and refusing to make any decisions seems like pretending that there is not problem at all. It's far from being constructive, not so say it's immature.
&lt;/p&gt;

Hi @DougJoseph, thanks for ticket!

I can't seem to reproduce this when I quickly tested. Can you test again with clean install and without any plugins?

And just so I'm not criticizing without action, my solution would be what @alexander.rohmann is suggesting: let's at least put a plan together. WordPress can't keep supporting 5.2 forever.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
it's not something that aligns with the WordPress philosophies and as such isn't something we'd do.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Philosophies can be amended, much like the Constitution. It's okay to say "We got this wrong the first time, here's an adjusted version of the philosophy."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In any other field, if a professional is aware that a service they're providing has an inherent issue (in our case, no security updates for the last 6 years), they'd be liable for a a complaint being filed against them to an ethical board and potentially having their license censured or revoked, and potentially even legal action taken against them. &lt;strong&gt;WordPress is knowingly not encouraging users who aren't aware of security threats to continue to use a version of PHP that is not maintained or supported anymore which may lead to their site being compromised.&lt;/strong&gt; WordPress is the "authority" or "expert" in this situation and isn't taking measures to educate those users who are unaware there's an issue in the first place.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; putting the users first.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
What about leaving &lt;code&gt;wp_localize_script&lt;/code&gt; as is for backward compatibility and introducing a new helper with better behavior?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/25280/25280.3.diff" title="Attachment '25280.3.diff' in Ticket #25280"&gt;25280.3.diff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/25280/25280.3.diff" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add a new helper function for passing data from PHP to JS: &lt;code&gt;wp_pass_data_to_script&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Includes passing tests from this ticket and &lt;a class="new ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/29722" title="#29722: defect (bug): wp_localize_script should be able to manage scalars (new)"&gt;#29722&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Hello. On the Twenty Seventeen theme, in the comments area, nested replies don't indent properly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The avatar indents, but the comment itself does not. This causes the comment to be partially covered up by the avatar.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I have confirmed the behavior occurring both on the default theme page with two columns, and on a full-width theme page with one column.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Below is a screenshot showing this issue in action:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Yes, the link you provided does change &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;#038&lt;/code&gt; but for me it did not happen. I am using the similar code:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;echo paginate_links(array(
   'total' =&amp;gt; $query-&amp;gt;max_num_pages,
   'format' =&amp;gt; 'page/%#%',
   'add_args' =&amp;gt; array( 'place' =&amp;gt; 1, 'type' =&amp;gt; 4),
));
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
URLs still come up as &lt;code&gt;http://local.tourplanner.com/page/2?place=1&amp;amp;type=4&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Browser: Chrome
WP Version: 4.7.2
Theme: Custom (no child theme)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Two differences between yours and mine are:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My site is still in localhost while yours is hosted
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am using a theme built from scratch, no parent theme used, although I believe that should not make any difference in this case.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Screenshot attached. Neither Status bar nor the Address bar has converted &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;#038&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Further inspecting the core function &lt;code&gt;update_action&lt;/code&gt; reveals something strange!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The value &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; is actually being treated as an empty string, but &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; is not! So when I am passing &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; for a key which I know does not exist there yet, &lt;code&gt;get_option&lt;/code&gt; returns an empty string (&lt;code&gt;$old_value = get_option( $option );&lt;/code&gt;), which when being compared in the following snippet:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;if ( $value === $old_value ) return false;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
always returning false as both &lt;code&gt;$value&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;$old_value&lt;/code&gt; are nothing but &lt;strong&gt;empty strings&lt;/strong&gt;!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is the reason &lt;code&gt;update_option('_option_key_index', false)&lt;/code&gt;, never adds a record in the database. But if I pass &lt;code&gt;update_option('_option_key_index', 0)&lt;/code&gt; it does.
&lt;/p&gt;

Although &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; is not being recognized a value 0 is actually adding / updating record in the table. So it is only Boolean &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; which is not working! I am under an impression that this value has a conflict somewhere in the function!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; - works. Value added is 1
&lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; - works. Value added is 1
&lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; - does not work - No record added
&lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; - works - Value added is 0
&lt;code&gt;'true'&lt;/code&gt; - works. Value added is 'true'
&lt;code&gt;'false'&lt;/code&gt; - works. Value added is 'false'
&lt;/p&gt;

My apology for closing the ticket. That was not intended. I will try once again.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
However, you should have been more precise. You mentioned about &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; but never mentioned what &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; did for you. This is a good practice to explain everything in detail as much as possible so that others know exactly where and what to look at.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thank you!

This ticket concerns e-mails which are sent in a multsite context when a blog's admin e-mail is changed, or a user changes their e-mail address.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If the sitename contains  HTML entities these appear in the e-mail - they are not decoded.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If the blogname contains quotes these appear in the e-mail as HTML entities. (&lt;a class="changeset" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/27801" title="Always decode special characters for email subjects.
props tlovett1, ..."&gt;[27801]&lt;/a&gt; decoded all but the quotes).
&lt;/p&gt;

Just edit the Site Address to what you want, save, done. Tested this on 4.6 and 4.7 and 4.8 and it works :)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So you didn't read me previous post where I said the following:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;THE “Site Address (URL)” FIELD IS NOT EDITABLE IN MY FRESH 4.7.2 INSTALLATION.&lt;/strong&gt; I can see the URL but can't edit it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So besides de wrong documentation, apparently there is a bug in current WordPress.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
According to the structure as of now the datatype the &lt;code&gt;option_name&lt;/code&gt; column in &lt;code&gt;wp_options&lt;/code&gt; is of string type (&lt;code&gt;varchar(191)&lt;/code&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The reason it does not add a record with &lt;code&gt;update_option('aaa2345454', false)&lt;/code&gt; is you are passing a Boolean value.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To add / update a record with value &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; you either need to pass it directly as string like
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;update_option('aaa2345454', 'false');
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
or in case you are grabbing this value from somewhere else which is a Boolean then you need to create a string alternative for your value before you actually send it:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;$value = true; //hard coding the $value here. You may be grabbing it from somewhere else.
$converted_value = ($value) ? 'true' : 'false';
update_option('aaa2345454', $converted_value)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The above would add / update the value in &lt;code&gt;wp_options&lt;/code&gt; table with a value either &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;option_value&lt;/code&gt; column. However, the value would not insert as a real Boolean type.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I want to add a Boolean false value, not STRING 'false' value, these are 2 different things.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Why &lt;code&gt;update_option( 'aaa2345', true )&lt;/code&gt; works and &lt;code&gt;update_option( 'aaa2346', false )&lt;/code&gt; does not?
I think you did not understand the issue here. I will reopen this, why close so fast? Just a close keyword is enough, maybe someone has a different opinion.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Even if &lt;code&gt;update_option( 'aaa2346', false )&lt;/code&gt; does not work it should at least insert a new row into the database.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I've looked into this a bit and there isn't really a great solution. The iframe that contains the video is automatically stretched to fill the screen, but YouTube has a resize handler that adjusts the dimensions of the video so that it always fits the screen rather than fill the iframe as desired.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I did go ahead and &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/bradyvercher/custom-header-youtube"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;put together a quick plugin&lt;/a&gt; that attempts to counteract YouTube's behavior by resizing the iframe to ensure the video always fills the container. I haven't done much testing with Twenty Seventeen and it only works with widescreen videos at the moment, but otherwise it should be pretty solid.
&lt;/p&gt;

I've forked the slurper and have written a parser for obtaining the sidebar args for the themes: &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/xwp/WordPress-Theme-Directory-Slurper/tree/master/feature-stats/registered-widget-sidebars"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://github.com/xwp/WordPress-Theme-Directory-Slurper/tree/master/feature-stats/registered-widget-sidebars&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here are stats from the parsing : &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sjm95-P7ocEL1m1TlAToL83TLNEijo9RKyBmERMA5hs/edit#gid=0"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sjm95-P7ocEL1m1TlAToL83TLNEijo9RKyBmERMA5hs/edit#gid=0&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The most common number of sidebars is 1. Half as common is to have 2, with a little bit less common to have 0 sidebars. Here are the top 10 sidebar counts:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class="wiki"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Sidebar Count&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Theme Quantity&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; 1        &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 1308
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; 2        &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 748
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; 0        &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 612
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; 4        &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 444
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; 5        &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 377

As for the most popular sidebar IDs used, here are the top ~30:

&lt;table class="wiki"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Sidebar ID&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Count&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; right-sidebar &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 80
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; sidebar-widget-area &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 76
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; footer &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 70
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; footer-widget-area &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 70
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; primary-sidebar &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 69
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; sidebar-left &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 68
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; footer-right &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 66
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; footer-left &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 65
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; sidebar-right &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 60
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; sidebar-7 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 56
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; footer-sidebar &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 52
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; primary &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 51
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There is a degree of normalization that can be done for these, such as replacing “fourth” with 4, removing hyphens, removing “sidebar” and “widget area” and so on.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Hi guys,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is a follow-up to &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30831" title="#30831: defect (bug): paginate_links() now needs add_args=false (closed: fixed)"&gt;#30831&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Using WordPress v4.7.2 . With paginate_links() and setting the 'add_args' to an an array of values breaks the url. Specifically replaces &lt;strong&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38" title="#38: enhancement: More Better Options Regarding Authors (closed: invalid)"&gt;#038&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sample code below:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;echo paginate_links(
    array(
       'base'    =&amp;gt; str_replace( $big, '%#%', esc_url( get_pagenum_link( $big ) ) ),
       'current' =&amp;gt; max( 1, get_query_var( 'paged' ) ),
       'total'   =&amp;gt; $query_object-&amp;gt;max_num_pages,
       'format' =&amp;gt; 'page/%#%',
       'add_args' =&amp;gt; array( 'project' =&amp;gt; 1 /* or whatever the project number is*/ ),
) );
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The code above replaces  &lt;strong&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38" title="#38: enhancement: More Better Options Regarding Authors (closed: invalid)"&gt;#038&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sample result: &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://domain.com/?page_id=1&amp;amp;paged=2#038project=1"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://domain.com/?page_id=1&amp;amp;paged=2#038project=1&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #40013 (Inifinite loop in subfolder) created</title>
      
        <dc:creator>dSero</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Thu, 02 Mar 2017 08:00:33 GMT</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Hi,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We implemented WP on a dedicated server, where /blog serves as a subfolder behind an AWS application ELB that directs all /blog traffic to this server. The ELB also offloads the SSL.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When configuring the WP, we faced an inifinte loop (301 redirect) on the /blog/ path, while intenral paths works great (/blog/trial for exmample).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When debugging the code, we found out that the "protect against chained redirects"  in /var/www/html/wp-includes/canonical.php actually doesn't work, as the if state should be true instead of false:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Please find trace below:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Pages flow:
index.php
wp-blog-header.php
require_once( ABSPATH . WPINC . '/template-loader.php' );
/var/www/html/wp-includes/template-loader.php
do_action( 'template_redirect' ); ==&amp;gt;
/var/www/html/wp-includes/default-filters.php
add_action( 'template_redirect', 'redirect_canonical' );
The actual broken code is in:
/var/www/html/wp-includes/canonical.php
=&amp;gt; $redirect_url is empty inside, so return;
And the broken code in it is:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;redirect_canonical&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$redirect_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// protect against chained redirects
&lt;/span&gt;                &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;redirect_canonical&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$redirect_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;wp_redirect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$redirect_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;301&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="k"&gt;exit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Looks like there is a bug when there a sub folder model is being used.
Instead of protecting from chained redirects, the if actually causes them, since the return from the funciton when URLs are the same if return;
So correct code should be:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;redirect_canonical&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$redirect_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
And not
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;redirect_canonical&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$redirect_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Ticket #40007 (update_option function does not work if the $value argument is false ...) closed</title>
      
        <dc:creator>subrataemfluence</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Thu, 02 Mar 2017 07:08:50 GMT</pubDate>

      <description>invalid: &lt;p&gt;
According to the structure as of now the datatype the &lt;code&gt;option_name&lt;/code&gt; column in &lt;code&gt;wp_options&lt;/code&gt; is of string type (&lt;code&gt;varchar(191)&lt;/code&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The reason it does not add a record with &lt;code&gt;update_option('aaa2345454', false)&lt;/code&gt; is you are passing a Boolean value.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To add / update a record with value &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; you either need to pass it directly as string like
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;update_option('aaa2345454', 'false');
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
or in case you are grabbing this value from somewhere else which is a Boolean then you need to create a string alternative for your value before you actually send it:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;$value = true; //hard coding the $value here. You may be grabbing it from somewhere else.
$converted_value = ($value) ? 'true' : 'false';
update_option('aaa2345454', $converted_value)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The above would add / update the value in &lt;code&gt;wp_options&lt;/code&gt; table with a value either &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;option_value&lt;/code&gt; column. However, the value would not insert as a real Boolean type.
&lt;/p&gt;

Since $lock_holder = get_userdata( $lock_holder ); will return false if user id userid not exit. and the rest functionality will work as expected.

We'll bump it prior to all stable releases - that means &lt;code&gt;branches/4.7&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;trunk/&lt;/code&gt; will need to be updated before each point release is made if it needs updating.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I've gone ahead and done so in:

Marking this as fixed for now, with the expectation that @kraftbj will re-open as future releases are made.
This is potentially something we should have as a phpunit test for trunk-only, verifying that the akismet external is up to date.

      <description>&lt;i&gt;Component&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Milestone&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Thanks for the detailed report and the patch, @mikejolley. I've attached a second patch that includes a test demonstrating the problem and the fix.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Regarding your point 2 - I would like to talk through what's happening here, since it seems like a change in behavior. I believe that your patch for 1 has turned up a bug, along the following lines:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's possible for there to be more than one member of &lt;code&gt;$name_matches&lt;/code&gt;, either because of accented characters (see the following block) or because of hierarchy branches like the one described in this ticket.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When no slug is provided to &lt;code&gt;wp_insert_term()&lt;/code&gt; and there's a name match (in the relevant part of the taxonomy), we generally want to return an error - this is one of the legacy error conditions of &lt;code&gt;wp_insert_term()&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's usually the case that the first member of the &lt;code&gt;$name_matches&lt;/code&gt; array will have the non-prefixed slug. That is: under normal circumstances (entering category names from the Dashboard), WP is responsible for generating slugs; so the first 'Child' will get the slug &lt;code&gt;child&lt;/code&gt;, the second will get &lt;code&gt;child-foo&lt;/code&gt;, etc. Since the default sort order of &lt;code&gt;get_terms()&lt;/code&gt; is by ID, &lt;code&gt;child&lt;/code&gt; will practically always be first.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This means that the &lt;code&gt;$name_match-&amp;gt;slug === $slug&lt;/code&gt; condition on line 2066 is usually met. But it's sorta coincidental that this works: if you first created 'Child' with the manual slug &lt;code&gt;child-foo&lt;/code&gt; and then created a second 'Child' with &lt;code&gt;child&lt;/code&gt;, you'd surface the bug, independently of the hierarchy issue described in this ticket.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Does that sound right to you? If so, there are really two bugs to fix here.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I can appreciate that. Although, at some point someone is left with the bill. Those users may not understand, but that doesn't make them any less responsible.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It's off-putting that you say something doesn't align with core philosophies, then in the next breath encourage plugin developers to take actions that violate those philosophies. Pardon me for saying it, but it kinda comes off as lack of leadership.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I never said do it tomorrow, but I'm very concerned there isn't a plan written up.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
WordPress is build around a 10 year old PHP version, that has been unsupported the past 6 of those years. I can't get my head around why that doesn't scream liability to everyone.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
How much time is wasted backporting what should be modern code to meet old constraints?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When does it become more costly to continue this, than to bother 2.5% of users? Users who could very easily be instructed and led through an update process, or presented with a choice of options.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Thinking about this more, there could be 4 types of uniqueness:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unique &lt;code&gt;meta_key&lt;/code&gt; to all objects
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unique &lt;code&gt;meta_key&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;$object_id&lt;/code&gt; (what &lt;code&gt;$unique&lt;/code&gt; currently checks)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unique &lt;code&gt;meta_key&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;meta_value&lt;/code&gt; to all objects
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unique &lt;code&gt;meta_key&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;meta_value&lt;/code&gt; the &lt;code&gt;$object_id&lt;/code&gt; (what my patch adds)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;
Thoughts on serving PHP 5.2 users security updates only? (explained in more detail above)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That punishes users for something they don't understand or control, so no, it's not something that aligns with the WordPress philosophies and as such isn't something we'd do.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
WordPress has become an ecosystem unto itself, which for the PHP developer means it's incredibly difficult to work on either side of the fence. Perpetuating adherence to unsupported technology is just an ever growing technical liability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And one which you're free to do what you want within - like I said, you don't have to support WordPress 3.7, although WordPress still supports it by shipping security releases for it - did you know we're up to &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://wordpress.org/download/release-archive/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;3.7.18?&lt;/a&gt;, likewise, you don't have to support PHP 5.x if you don't want to, you can make your plugin PHP 7.x only if you want, you'll just need to educate your users who can't use it about how to update their systems - if your plugin requires newer features you're in a far better place to educate the user as to why you need it than WordPress is.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yes, I'd prefer WordPress dropped support for PHP 5.2, 5.3 and even 5.4 - there's 1/3 of the WordPress 4.7 user-base right there, but I don't think it's an effort which at this time can be pushed by WordPress itself, some plugins such as &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo/issues/6293"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;Yoast SEO&lt;/a&gt; are planning to throw notices to older PHP users in an attempt to get their user base to update so that they can bump their minimum PHP versions, I'm eagerly awaiting to see how that goes and to see if it can form the basis of a larger push from the WordPress community as a whole, rather than relying upon WordPress core itself to be the driving force.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Nobody said blindly drop support. The point of this conversation is to find a path forward. I've still not gotten any direct feedback on my major version proposal. Thoughts on serving PHP 5.2 users security updates only? (explained in more detail above)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While WordPress is a big part of the web, you can not deny that this fractures the development community as a whole.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
WordPress has become an ecosystem unto itself, which for the PHP developer means it's incredibly difficult to work on either side of the fence. Perpetuating adherence to unsupported technology is just an ever growing technical liability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You keep coming back to "users first" - then find a solution that keeps them first, but also moves things forward.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
you shared some pretty interesting data. Any chance on getting those for March 2017?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I actually tweeted that data recently - &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://twitter.com/dd32/status/834613251178508289"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://twitter.com/dd32/status/834613251178508289&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
WP4.7-only stats of [PHP] 5.6 @ 43%, 5.4 @ 20%, and 5.5 @ 14%, PHP 7.x is @ ~10% leaving only 12% for PHP 5.2+5.3
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;PHP 5.2: ~2.5%
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;PHP 5.3: 9%
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;PHP 5.4: 20%
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;PHP 5.5: 14%
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;PHP 5.6: 43%
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;PHP 7.0: 10%
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;PHP 7.1: ~1.5%
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
(Note, these numbers are rounded, yet shockingly add up to 100%)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While PHP 5.2 for WordPress 4.7 is at &amp;lt;3% now, which is much lower than the ~5.5% figure which represents all versions 3.0~4.7, what those figures don't tell you is just how many people would be affected by a forced change.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On average, at every WordPress event you go to, 3 out of every 100 people are probably running PHP 5.2 - and have no idea what PHP is, there are hundreds of thousands (or millions) of people who are in that group of people.
You could say that those 3 people probably don't go to WordPress events, but you'd be surprised, they're the new users on bad hosts, those who have had a WordPress site that had just worked for the last 5+ years, they're the ones who rely upon WordPress doing it's job and running their site, taking away all the technicalities of publishing on the web.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
WordPress isn't going to blindly drop support for those users - and we're not going to bump the required version of PHP while not actually requiring it - that user experience comes first.
Moving to PHP 5.3 gains core nothing, Moving to PHP 5.4 gains core nothing either - if there were features in those versions which were needed by WordPress - we'd have moved already.
Supporting the older versions in core does not bring a significant barrier to contributors, many new functions that we've needed (JSON, Hashing, PHP7 random functions, Multibyte and autoload) have been &lt;a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/src/wp-includes/compat.php"&gt;shimmed&lt;/a&gt; with PHP variants which allow us to use the functionality in the older versions - sure, it might not be as performant, but it works just fine.
If PHP versions prevent you from contributing to WordPress, submit the patch anyway and note it requires PHP 8, someone else can alter it to work back to 5.2 - determining what the issue is and what code needs to fix it is 90% of the work.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Plugins and Themes can require a higher version of PHP than what WordPress does. You do not have to support an outdated version of PHP or outdated install of WordPress&lt;/strong&gt; - I don't support anything older than PHP 5.4 and WordPress 4.4 at present, that's a choice I've made, and every time someone contacts me (at least once a week) asking why the plugin doesn't work for them, I explain that the detailed error message meant they need to contact their host, you can do that too.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #40012 (Only add_metadata if no matching value) created</title>
      
        <dc:creator>johnjamesjacoby</dc:creator>

      <pubDate>Thu, 02 Mar 2017 02:04:43 GMT</pubDate>

      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40012/1488420283914374</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;add_metadata()&lt;/code&gt; has a &lt;code&gt;$unique&lt;/code&gt; parameter, but it only looks for a unique &lt;code&gt;meta_key&lt;/code&gt; for the given object ID. I have a need to add meta-data with the same &lt;code&gt;meta_key&lt;/code&gt; but different values, and only if that &lt;code&gt;meta_value&lt;/code&gt; isn't already present with the same key.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To do this now, requires:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Getting all meta-data for the ID by &lt;code&gt;meta_key&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Checking those array-values for my value
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bailing if it's already present, or...
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Proceeding with &lt;code&gt;$unique&lt;/code&gt; set to &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It'd be lovely if &lt;code&gt;add_metadata()&lt;/code&gt; either:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Accepted strings like &lt;code&gt;key&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; for the &lt;code&gt;$unique&lt;/code&gt; parameter, to switch up the check
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Added a second parameter for unique value in addition to a unique key
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <description>invalid: &lt;p&gt;
Hi @subrataemfluence and welcome to Trac.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Unfortunately this isn't a core WordPress bug - WordPress is unable to modify the files it's mentioned, this is likely due to mixed permissions on the server (or mixed file owners).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You'll need to manually fix the errors on your webhost by using FTP or your web hosts control panel.
Your web host may also be willing to help you fix the inconsistent permissions, you'll have to contact their support for that though.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'm marking this as invalid due to it being a server configuration issue.
&lt;/p&gt;

@westonruter
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
here is the output of _wpCustomizeSettings.controls.site_icon.attachment . Sizes is actually not empty, but the "full" size is missing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The fix addresses the symptom. If the root cause is no full size being generated, that should be fixed seperately.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You are right that jetpack is involved. Deactivating jetpack (wp plugin deactivate jetpack --network) works around the problem. The other way around it is to delete the site_icon option ( wp --url=&amp;lt;yoursite.local&amp;gt; option delete site_icon ).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;"id"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;44&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;"title"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"cropped-mars-1.jpg"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;"filename"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"cropped-mars-1.jpg"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

Proposed patch does it similarly like other tests do (e.g. &lt;code&gt;rest-attachments-controller.php&lt;/code&gt;)

@aussieguy123 also, if you open up your console, what does &lt;code&gt;_wpCustomizeSettings.controls.site_icon.attachment&lt;/code&gt; output? I'm expecting it to have an empty &lt;code&gt;sizes&lt;/code&gt; property. But I want to know what the other properties are as well. Please attach the JSON.
&lt;/p&gt;

@aussieguy123 This is only happening in a context where Jetpack's Photon service is being used, right?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Does your patch fix the problem or just the symptom? In other words, if image sizes are being dynamically generated, is the original image going to be shown?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It could be that there is actually a Jetpack issue where where it should be filtering &lt;code&gt;wp_prepare_attachment_for_js&lt;/code&gt; to supply all of the added image &lt;code&gt;sizes&lt;/code&gt; with URLs off to the WordPress.com endpoints.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
In some contexts (e.g. privacy-sensitive), the Origin header is "null".
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In these cases the REST API responds with an Access-Control-Allow-Origin header with the value "&lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://$origin"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://$origin&lt;/a&gt;", since the original origin goes through esc_url_raw() before rendering.  The browser then does not consider these equivalent and aborts the request with:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header has a value '&lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://null"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;http://null&lt;/a&gt;' that is not equal to the supplied origin. Origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access.
&lt;/p&gt;

Hi,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It should be OK in RTL,
What is your current theme ?
Please change your theme to default one, like twentyfifteen and also disable your plugins temporary
And check it again
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Looks like &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/36749" title="#36749: defect (bug): Customizer wont load: issue with site-icon control (closed: fixed)"&gt;#36749&lt;/a&gt; has shown itself again in the latest core commits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I've attached a patch, which fixes this issue.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Seems that the template is not checking if data.attachment.sizes.full exists before printing out  data.attachment.sizes.full.url. This causes a console error (trying to get property url from a non-object).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To reproduce:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Open Customizer
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Under site identity upload an image
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Publish
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Refresh the page
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Expected:
Page loads normally with new icon
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Actual:
Page partially loads, customizer is broken
&lt;/p&gt;

Curiously, there is a linear relationship between the highest ticket number and the approximate total number of tickets.  I wonder if this will continue to hold over time?

The most conservative approach to this appears to be a no-brainer - raising PHP versioning while keeping the same coding standards for core and banning PHP godsends like namespaces and anonymous functions for the indefinite future, would allow for security backports without maintaining two versions, would do a great job testing the water, and would encourage new plugins to finally begin coding with efficient constructs that WordPress documentation endorses (forget where but there are various coding examples with actions and anonymous function pairings... A beautiful thing).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It would do a fair bit to encourage better plugins in the repository and would allow a user to do so just by specifying a minimum WordPress version.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
No change to core code = no duplication for security backports. Tests the water. Applies pressure to hosts without harming user experience. Please, please do this.
&lt;/p&gt;

If all you care about is the themes hosted on .org, then someone can grab the slurper and figure out a better search than I did. The data is right there for y'all to search and you don't need me for that. I happened to have some of it handy when Mel asked is all.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thanks, I'll try to figure out something to grab the sidebar IDs. And thanks for doing that initial getting the initial rundown of the sidebar Names. That gave us the initial direction we needed.
&lt;/p&gt;

Listing what plugins are installed is somewhat of a different order of magnitude. And while I laud GoDaddy for doing that, I personally find it right on the edge of things where I'm violating privileged information. Like disclosing how many users, on average, people have on a site is different. @mikeschroder  may have a different opinion of course, but like I said, I'd have to ask and my (PERSONAL) knee-jerk reaction is "No."
&lt;/p&gt;

@Ipstenu Correct me if I'm misreading what @westonruter is asking for, but such stats would be delivered in aggregate and not personally-identifiable. I think it's important for hosts to try to provide anonymous/aggregated trend data back to the community when they can, similar to &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wordpress-hot-100/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wordpress-hot-100/&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Oh I see why you asked me about DH.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A host could run a script that iterates over each WP site, grabs out the sidebars_widgets option, and then collect stats on:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sure we could. But that runs into some SERIOUS privacy concerns, and my knee-jerk reaction is "I am absolutely not giving you customer data like that."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To explain why the search from the theme slurper is kind of junk, it's basically that people format code in different ways.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Example:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;themes/aaron/functions.php:46:          register_nav_menus( array(
themes/abacus/functions.php:77:         register_nav_menu( 'top', __( 'Top Menu', 'abacus' ) );
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
And if I hop into the aaron theme:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;                register_nav_menus( array(
                        'header' =&amp;gt; __( 'Primary Menu', 'aaron' ),
                        'social' =&amp;gt; __( 'Social Menu', 'aaron' ),
                ) );
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Scanning for both of those can be a bit tricky. Getting all that data and outputting it into something useful and readable is doubly so.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Two options for you to download and search for it yourself though:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/aaronjorbin/WordPress-Theme-Directory-Slurper"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://github.com/aaronjorbin/WordPress-Theme-Directory-Slurper&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/Ipstenu/WordPress-Theme-Directory-Slurper"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://github.com/Ipstenu/WordPress-Theme-Directory-Slurper&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Mine's a fork of the current plugin slurper.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
A very helpful way for hosts to provide support on this issue would be to share some statistics on the widget sidebars for the sites the host. WordPress stores the widget configurations for the sidebars in a PHP-serialized &lt;code&gt;sidebars_widgets&lt;/code&gt; option in the DB that looks like:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'sidebar-1'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'search-2'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'meta-2'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'sidebar-2'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'archives-5'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'calendar-10'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'wp_inactive_widgets'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'text-3'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'recent-comments-3'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
A host could run a script that iterates over each WP site, grabs out the &lt;code&gt;sidebars_widgets&lt;/code&gt; option, and then collect stats on:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Logs the sidebar IDs for the site (the array keys)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Counts the number of widgets in each sidebar (the count for each nested array).
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Then given that a script has done:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$sidebars_widgets&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;get_option&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'sidebars_widgets'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;empty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$sidebars_widgets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'array_version'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$sidebars_widgets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'array_version'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;unset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$sidebars_widgets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'array_version'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Then, if we can get stats on:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The most commonly used sidebar IDs (&lt;code&gt;array_keys( $sidebars_widgets )&lt;/code&gt;)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The number of sidebars registered (&lt;code&gt;count( $sidebars_widgets )&lt;/code&gt;)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Counts the number of widgets in each sidebar (&lt;code&gt;array_map( 'count', $sidebars_widgets ) )&lt;/code&gt;) and perhaps a sum of them (&lt;code&gt;call_user_func_array( 'array_sum', array_map( 'count', $sidebars_widgets ) ) )&lt;/code&gt;).
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;code&gt;wp_inactive_widgets&lt;/code&gt; sidebar is also a special case which will help with designing &lt;a class="assigned ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27404" title="#27404: feature request: Widget Customizer: Allow adding inactive widgets to widget areas (assigned)"&gt;#27404&lt;/a&gt;.

My thoughts:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Needs seems genuine
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Patch seems reasonable
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Approach is similar to others we use in core
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This could go in as-is, or the patch could be refreshed to include phpdoc in the tests like @chriscct7 mentioned
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Paging @johnbillion, who marked himself as owner. Able to see this through?

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
@celloexpressions I found what I think is one clear defect with the patch, and that is the Additional CSS control:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a style="padding:0; border:none" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/32296/additional-css-control-zoomed-out.png"&gt;&lt;img width="300" crossorigin="anonymous" src="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/32296/additional-css-control-zoomed-out.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The color control and site icon controls aren't appearing full width according to the sidebar, but I think that is to be expected and out be out of scope here. The Additional CSS &lt;code&gt;textarea&lt;/code&gt; seems to me like it should be accounted for here, don't you?
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #39692 (Fix missing assignment of menus on theme switch) updated</title>

Following up on this ticket after posting &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39693#comment:20" title="#39693: enhancement: Fix missing assignment of widgets on theme switch (closed: fixed)"&gt;39693#comment:20&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If your old theme and new theme share a similar (not the same) IDs or name, map them automatically (so, primary, main, menu 1, etc. are all similar in concept)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
@ipstenu grabbed some data for us from the theme directory. &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/meta/p1488318470703436"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;Logs here&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Most common menu area names seem to be:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Main
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Primary
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Secondary
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Footer
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Navigation
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Subsidiary
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Using that info &amp;amp; some more research, I think we can do this:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Main, Primary, and Navigation (along with any combination of these, like Main Navigation) can all be mapped to each other
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Secondary and Subsidiary can be mapped to each other
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anything with "Footer" or "Bottom" in it can be mapped, if they don't match
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anything with "Social" in it can be mapped, if they don't match
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anything with "Top" in it can be mapped, if they don't match
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This is in addition to:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If your old theme only has one menu and your new theme only has one menu, just map them automatically.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If your old theme has more than one menu, or your new theme has more than one menu, map the menu in the first menu location in your old theme to the first menu location in the new theme.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</description>

      <description>invalid: &lt;p&gt;
I reviewed the code of &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://wordpress.org/themes/twentyfifteen/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;twentyfifteen theme&lt;/a&gt; because my child theme is based on twentyfifteen theme...
in file function.php I found this line:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Load our main stylesheet.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;wp_enqueue_style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'twentyfifteen-style'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;get_stylesheet_uri&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So this will lead to load the style.css using default &lt;strong&gt;WordPress version&lt;/strong&gt; and NOT the theme itself!
I think this part should be fix in the theme twentyfifteen too (May be in other default theme too) ...
First I changed the line to this:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;wp_enqueue_style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'twentyfifteen-style'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;get_stylesheet_uri&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;wp_get_theme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Version'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Using &lt;code&gt; wp_get_theme()-&amp;gt;get( 'Version' ) &lt;/code&gt; both child theme and parent theme get correct version when they load
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I checked other default WordPress themes (2014,2015,2016,2017) , They all missed the version of theme
So I think this is needed for them because of future update of style.css
It is prefer to the default WordPress version, It should load the version of theme and not WordPress version
&lt;/p&gt;

Given the data gathered from themes, perhaps we can use this as an opportunity to codify recommendations in the theme handbook for how sidebars should be named? If a theme author knows that the way they name their sidebars is important, they can re-use the sidebar ids that are recognized in core for mapping and easy the switching into their theme.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ticket #33381 (Strategize the updating of minimum PHP version.) updated</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
We both seem to agree on that matter. The migration certainly &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; possible and such way has been proposed several times already. Nonetheless, all that core developers keep saying is that it's &lt;em&gt;"too early"&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Maybe there is a tiny chance to agree upon &lt;strong&gt;what&lt;/strong&gt; PHP 5.2 usage is acceptable. It's clear that it decreases but publicly available stats might include many abandoned websites which are not updated anymore and thus will not be affected by any minimal requirements bump. That's why I'd like to know what's the PHP version share across more recent WP releases.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Meanwhile, number of potential improvements postponed due to the ancient (over six years since EOL!) gets bigger and bigger... I also really struggle to understand why there is no interest in engaging more PHP developers to contribute by getting closer to today's standards. As you said, it &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be done without leaving milions of users on unsecure versions (contrary to letting them use PHP versions with so many known vulnerabilities).
&lt;/p&gt;

If version requirements were introduced in a major release it wouldn't even matter. Hosts on old versions of PHP could still get the WordPress minor release security updates. It would take two major cycles. One in preparation that adds messaging, and blocks incompatible servers from getting major releases, then another to actually implement it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But... it would seem the powers that be would rather continue disenfranchising plugin and theme developers than take a few minutes to think it all through.
&lt;/p&gt;

If your old theme and new theme share a similar IDs or names, map them automatically
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
@ipstenu grabbed some data for us from the theme directory. &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/meta/p1488318470703436"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;Logs here&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Most common widget area names seem to be:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar (with Sidebar1, Sidebar2, etc being right down the line)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Main (with a Main Sidebar being a very popular second)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;[Left|Right] Sidebar
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Bottom, footer, header, and custom were clustered together in the list of widget areas. Many more are "Footer [something]."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Surprisingly, the data seemed to indicate that Left Sidebar was more common than Right Sidebar. I don't know if we should map Left to Sidebar, etc., and Right with Sidebar2, based on that, or go with my gut and do Sidebar --&amp;gt; Right, Sidebar 2 --&amp;gt; Left. Let's &lt;em&gt;try&lt;/em&gt; the latter option and then test a bunch of themes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think, using this info and some research of my own, we could assume:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar, Sidebar 1, Main, Main Sidebar, Primary, Primary Sidebar, Right Sidebar, and First can all be mapped to each other
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar 2, Left Sidebar, and Second can be mapped to each other
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Footer and Bottom can be mapped to each other
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Header and Top can be mapped to each other
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
And if always, if there's an exact match, it should map to that widget area. Or, if your old theme only has one widget area and your new theme only has one widget area, just map them automatically.
&lt;/p&gt;

@edge22 this may in fact be a duplicate of &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39693" title="#39693: enhancement: Fix missing assignment of widgets on theme switch (closed: fixed)"&gt;#39693&lt;/a&gt;. I assume in your case that after you rename the directory, you have to then go in and re-activate the theme? In this case the issue would be happening as part of a theme switch and the issue is with the re-mapping of widgets to sidebars across themes. Please confirm.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Kind of an interesting issue.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let's say you have a set of widgets created:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;add_action( 'widgets_init', 'samples_widgets_init' );
function sample_widgets_init()
{
	// Set up our array of widgets
	$widgets = array(
		'sidebar-1' =&amp;gt; __( 'Right Sidebar' ),
		'sidebar-2' =&amp;gt; __( 'Left Sidebar' ),
		'header' =&amp;gt; __( 'Header' ),
		'footer-1' =&amp;gt; __( 'Footer Widget 1' ),
		'footer-2' =&amp;gt; __( 'Footer Widget 2' ),
		'footer-3' =&amp;gt; __( 'Footer Widget 3' ),
		'footer-4' =&amp;gt; __( 'Footer Widget 4' ),
		'footer-5' =&amp;gt; __( 'Footer Widget 5' ),
		'footer-bar' =&amp;gt; __( 'Footer Bar' )
	);
	// Loop through them to create our widget areas
	foreach ( $widgets as $id =&amp;gt; $name ) {
		register_sidebar( array(
			'name'          =&amp;gt; $name,
			'id'            =&amp;gt; $id,
			'before_widget' =&amp;gt; '&amp;lt;aside id="%1$s" class="widget %2$s"&amp;gt;',
			'after_widget'  =&amp;gt; '&amp;lt;/aside&amp;gt;',
			'before_title'  =&amp;gt; '&amp;lt;h4 class="widget-title"&amp;gt;',
			'after_title'   =&amp;gt; '&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;',
		) );
	}
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Works perfectly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ok, now let's insert a new widget area into the mix (not at the end).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;add_action( 'widgets_init', 'samples_widgets_init' );
function sample_widgets_init()
{
	// Set up our array of widgets
	$widgets = array(
		'sidebar-1' =&amp;gt; __( 'Right Sidebar' ),
		'sidebar-2' =&amp;gt; __( 'Left Sidebar' ),
		'top-bar' =&amp;gt; __( 'Top Bar' ),
		'header' =&amp;gt; __( 'Header' ),
		'footer-1' =&amp;gt; __( 'Footer Widget 1' ),
		'footer-2' =&amp;gt; __( 'Footer Widget 2' ),
		'footer-3' =&amp;gt; __( 'Footer Widget 3' ),
		'footer-4' =&amp;gt; __( 'Footer Widget 4' ),
		'footer-5' =&amp;gt; __( 'Footer Widget 5' ),
		'footer-bar' =&amp;gt; __( 'Footer Bar' )
	);
	// Loop through them to create our widget areas
	foreach ( $widgets as $id =&amp;gt; $name ) {
		register_sidebar( array(
			'name'          =&amp;gt; $name,
			'id'            =&amp;gt; $id,
			'before_widget' =&amp;gt; '&amp;lt;aside id="%1$s" class="widget %2$s"&amp;gt;',
			'after_widget'  =&amp;gt; '&amp;lt;/aside&amp;gt;',
			'before_title'  =&amp;gt; '&amp;lt;h4 class="widget-title"&amp;gt;',
			'after_title'   =&amp;gt; '&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;',
		) );
	}
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So we've added a top bar widget area above the header.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;This works fine, UNLESS the theme folder name changes.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So let's say someone downloads this new version from GitHub and keeps the -master part of the folder name and they activate it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All of a sudden, the widget that was in the Footer 1 area is moved into the Header widget area.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My assumption would be that since we have an ID set, the order shouldn't change regardless of new widget areas being inserted into the mix.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The same things happens without the foreach as well.
&lt;/p&gt;

After PHPUnit's multisite tests have run two files are not removed from the test/s that created them:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;svn st
?       tests/phpunit/data/images/canola-150x150.jpg
?       tests/phpunit/data/images/canola-300x225.jpg
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
To reproduce:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Run  &lt;code&gt;grunt phpunit:multisite&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;https://develop.svn.wordpress.org/trunk&lt;/code&gt; followed by &lt;code&gt;svn status&lt;/code&gt;

Patch for the global notifications can also include the panel/section-specific notifications from &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38794" title="#38794: enhancement: Customize: Allow panels and sections to have notifications just like ... (closed: fixed)"&gt;#38794&lt;/a&gt;. Since they should re-use the same code, implementing the notifications for root, panels, and sections together will ensure that the right abstractions are implemented. As part of this, &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/37727" title="#37727: enhancement: Allow for customize control notifications to have extensible templates (closed: fixed)"&gt;#37727&lt;/a&gt; should also be considered.

      <description>&lt;i&gt;Keywords&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Ready for dev.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For the API, I suggest that we introduce &lt;code&gt;wp.customize.notifications&lt;/code&gt; which is a of &lt;code&gt;wp.customize.Values&lt;/code&gt; (collection) instance of &lt;code&gt;wp.customize.Notifications&lt;/code&gt;. This would mirror what is added to controls and settings. When this collection changes, the notifications should be re-rendered just as they are done on controls.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There should be an opportunity to factor out the current code from controls to some &lt;code&gt;utils&lt;/code&gt; namespace to re-use between control notifications and root notifications, while also allowing the code to be re-used for implementing notifications on panels and sections (see &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38794" title="#38794: enhancement: Customize: Allow panels and sections to have notifications just like ... (closed: fixed)"&gt;#38794&lt;/a&gt;). For some sample code, see:
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
@westonruter Chatted with @karmatosed and we agree:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What about when a user is not at the root of the customizer but instead has a panel open? Will the notification area just not be visible in that case?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We'd continue showing them at the top of the Customizer, until dismissed (or fixed).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What if there is more than one notification needing to be displayed? Or would we only allow one to be displayed at a time? Or if there are multiple, would they just stack vertically?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Stack all of them vertically.
&lt;/p&gt;

Fully agreee with Aaron here.  We can add the &lt;code&gt;has-alot&lt;/code&gt; keyword now, but we should not remove the corresponding &lt;code&gt;needs&lt;/code&gt; keyword, as &lt;code&gt;alot&lt;/code&gt; is a need that can never truly be satisfied.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Our test suite has grown quite large, so this issue (edit: &lt;a class="closed ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40008" title="#40008: defect (bug): A multisite test (currently unknown) should remove added image thumbnails (closed: fixed)"&gt;#40008&lt;/a&gt;) is perhaps best understood visually.  &lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/40000/alot-of-canola.png" title="Attachment 'alot-of-canola.png' in Ticket #40000"&gt;alot-of-canola.png&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/40000/alot-of-canola.png" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt; is a representation of the current state of the test suite, and &lt;a class="attachment" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/40000/alotoftests.png" title="Attachment 'alotoftests.png' in Ticket #40000"&gt;alotoftests.png&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="trac-rawlink" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/raw-attachment/ticket/40000/alotoftests.png" title="Download"&gt;​&lt;/a&gt; is more like where we want to be.  Except with more tests.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since no one really knows what a "canola" looks like, I have decided that a corn emoji  is an acceptable stand-in.
&lt;/p&gt;

I can't believe such a old function and very used one have a bug.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
If we specify a false argument in update_option function and if the database option does not exist then the option will not be saved.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I expect the option to be saved with false value if it does not exist.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If we look into the code of this function we can see that it will return false if the old value is false too, so if the option does not exists then it will return false.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It's a bug.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
How to replicate? give a try:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;update_option&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'aaa2345454'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39952#comment:1/1488385564878360</guid>
      <description>&lt;i&gt;Keywords&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Would you mind telling how to reproduce the issue? An example code would be handy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Replying to &lt;a class="new ticket" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39952" title="#39952: defect (bug): Category Dropdown Widget: required spacing issue on attachments template (new)"&gt;tribalNerd&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This issue only happens on the attachments.php template, all other primary templates don't appear to have the issue.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When using the category widget as a dropdown, the select statement looks like: &amp;lt;selectname='cat' rather than &amp;lt;select name='cat'
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The file, category-template.php output statement is:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$output&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&amp;lt;select &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;$required&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; name='&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;$name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;' id='&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;$id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;' class='&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;$class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;$tab_index_attribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Removing $required corrects the issue.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Setting required to true also corrects the issue.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;categories_dropdown&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'required'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;add_filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'widget_categories_dropdown_args'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'categories_dropdown'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Which returns:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;&amp;lt;select required="" name="cat" id="cat" class="postform"&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
While this does correct the issue, the required="" isn't correct either, it should be: required without the =""
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It should also have aria-required="true" for Safari.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
This gist has a demo of how to use WP's admin_post_thumbnail_html filter to insert content in featured image metabox. Posting here because someone found me on twitter to ask about the solution and figured anyone else stumbling here would find this useful too:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
[EDIT -- UPDATED URL (prev. had 'jeremyclarke' as username]
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://gist.github.com/jerclarke/faa6a9da4b0dfe5c524016b40b67a164"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://gist.github.com/jerclarke/faa6a9da4b0dfe5c524016b40b67a164&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Contains a bunch of notes about nuances of this filter, which is a bit unpredictable.

In the file &lt;a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/src/wp-admin/includes/update.php#L418,"&gt;wp-admin/includes/update.php&lt;/a&gt; there is an action &lt;code&gt; do_action( "in_plugin_update_message-{$file}", $plugin_data, $response ); &lt;/code&gt;. The comments declares $response as an array but its and object containing the plugin data. The list of plugin data also seems somewhat incomplete. But I'm unsure if all fields I see are always present. The property "tested" seems useful to add at least.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
If you understand how the child's theme's stylesheet is loaded, that'd help to track down where things went wrong. For example, the ID "twentyfifteen-style-css" was created by the following line...
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;wp_enqueue_style( 'twentyfifteen-style', get_stylesheet_uri() );
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It &lt;strong&gt;exists in parent theme&lt;/strong&gt;. It is simply overridden by child theme. So, naturally, the syntax is clear. The fourth parameter, if not set any value (or null), WP would attach its version number. Direct quote...
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
(string|bool|null) (Optional) String specifying stylesheet version number, if it has one, which is added to the URL as a query string for cache busting purposes. If version is set to false, a version number is automatically added equal to current installed WordPress version. If set to null, no version is added.
Default value: false
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

You may use &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/string-locator/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;string location plugin&lt;/a&gt; to find the exact string/s, such as "parent-style", as "-css" is added by WordPress core.

Thanks for checking my demo installation. In mine, TwentyFifteen didn't create the ID named "parent-style-css". How was it created on your localhost WP install?

Not necessarily, you could do something like this:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;function wp40005_filter_document_title( $title ) {
	remove_filter( 'pre_get_document_title', __FUNCTION__ );
	$title = wp_get_document_title();
	add_filter( 'pre_get_document_title', __FUNCTION__ );
	// Change the output
	// $title = ...
	return $title;
}
add_filter( 'pre_get_document_title', 'wp40005_filter_document_title' );

@pothi و
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thank you for your investigation,
As I see in your source of subdomain, You can find this line:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;&amp;lt;link rel='stylesheet' id='twentyfifteen-style-css'  href='http://wp.tinywp.com/wp-content/themes/twentyfifteen-child/style.css?ver=4.7.2' type='text/css' media='all' /&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Your child theme version is 1.0.0, And according to my reported issue, It loaded the style.css using version 4.7.2, But it should be 1.0.0
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;My function.php is empty&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;My child style.css file is very simple, like your mentioned style&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Regards
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
My apologies to close the ticket prematurely.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Can you please post the content of your child theme's style.css file and functions.php file?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If functions.php file is empty, well, you don't need to share it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Btw, here's the live demo of a site that uses a child theme for TwentyFifteen theme... wp.tinywp.com
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The content of my child theme's style.css is...
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;/*
 * Theme Name: TwentyFifteen Child
 * Template: twentyfifteen
 * Version: 1.0.0
 */
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In my case, style.css file of the parent theme is &lt;strong&gt;correctly&lt;/strong&gt; overridden by the child theme, as the parent theme's functions.php contains the following code...
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;/**
 * Enqueue scripts and styles.
 *
 * @since Twenty Fifteen 1.0
 */
function twentyfifteen_scripts() {
    // Add custom fonts, used in the main stylesheet.
    wp_enqueue_style( 'twentyfifteen-fonts', twentyfifteen_fonts_url(), array(), null );
    // Add Genericons, used in the main stylesheet.
    wp_enqueue_style( 'genericons', get_template_directory_uri() . '/genericons/genericons.css', array(), '3.2' );
    // Load our main stylesheet.
    wp_enqueue_style( 'twentyfifteen-style', get_stylesheet_uri() );
    // Load the Internet Explorer specific stylesheet.
    wp_enqueue_style( 'twentyfifteen-ie', get_template_directory_uri() . '/css/ie.css', array( 'twentyfifteen-style' ), '20141010' );
    wp_style_add_data( 'twentyfifteen-ie', 'conditional', 'lt IE 9' );
    // Load the Internet Explorer 7 specific stylesheet.
    wp_enqueue_style( 'twentyfifteen-ie7', get_template_directory_uri() . '/css/ie7.css', array( 'twentyfifteen-style' ), '20141010' );
    wp_style_add_data( 'twentyfifteen-ie7', 'conditional', 'lt IE 8' );
    wp_enqueue_script( 'twentyfifteen-skip-link-focus-fix', get_template_directory_uri() . '/js/skip-link-focus-fix.js', array(), '20141010', true );
    if ( is_singular() &amp;amp;&amp;amp; comments_open() &amp;amp;&amp;amp; get_option( 'thread_comments' ) ) {
        wp_enqueue_script( 'comment-reply' );
    }
    if ( is_singular() &amp;amp;&amp;amp; wp_attachment_is_image() ) {
        wp_enqueue_script( 'twentyfifteen-keyboard-image-navigation', get_template_directory_uri() . '/js/keyboard-image-navigation.js', array( 'jquery' ), '20141010' );
    }
    wp_enqueue_script( 'twentyfifteen-script', get_template_directory_uri() . '/js/functions.js', array( 'jquery' ), '20150330', true );
    wp_localize_script( 'twentyfifteen-script', 'screenReaderText', array(
        'expand'   =&amp;gt; '&amp;lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&amp;gt;' . __( 'expand child menu', 'twentyfifteen' ) . '&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;',
        'collapse' =&amp;gt; '&amp;lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&amp;gt;' . __( 'collapse child menu', 'twentyfifteen' ) . '&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;',
    ) );
}
add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', 'twentyfifteen_scripts' );
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So, can you please share your style.css file and functions.php file (if it is not empty)?
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Instead, I think the change we should make here is to enable setting a post to the same &lt;code&gt;template&lt;/code&gt; value that it currently has - this should be a no-op even if the current theme doesn't support that value.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This seems like a reasonable decision to me.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
@dd32 I don't have a specific use case, other than the original presented: a client POSTing back the same data it received.
&lt;/p&gt;

Hello @saeed205, thanks for the bug report. Is the issue that the button text is overflowing outside the button and the button should be bigger? Also, can you explain how you reach this screen, is this media-&amp;gt;new or are you in a post inserting media?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The issue at hand is triggering the close of the overlay/preview when using browser history to reach the new theme page (could be back or forward). The new code simulates a click on the close button and fixes the issue where the model underlying the preview gets reset incorrectly. I wanted to put this up for review and also keep trying to determine a better approach.
&lt;/p&gt;

Hi @subrataemfluence,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Friends please please attention!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When you use a child theme, WordPress loads the child style.css automatically without using any extra code!
if you use &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_enqueue_style/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;wp_enqueue_style&lt;/a&gt; to include child style.css, It double loads this file
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So please check the source exactly before commenting here, you can create a child theme using just 1 style.css file and activate it and check this issue!
And please don't close this ticket again :)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thank you for your time ! :)
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>invalid: &lt;p&gt;
First, &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_enqueue_style/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;wp_enqueue_style&lt;/a&gt; is not a plugin. It is a WordPress core function used to introduce CSS style sheets to a theme with the ability to pass several values by help of function parameters in order make sure it renders exactly the way we want!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This function is usually written in theme's &lt;code&gt;functions.php&lt;/code&gt; file. If no version is specified WordPress will auto assign parent theme's version.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;/* Syntax: wp_enqueue_style( string $handle, string $src = '', array $deps = array(), string|bool|null $ver = false, string $media = 'all' ) */
wp_enqueue_style('style', get_stylesheet_uri(), array(), '1.0', 'all');
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I could not reproduce the issue when I created a child theme and assign a version number (in my case it is &lt;code&gt;1.0&lt;/code&gt;) to &lt;code&gt;style.css&lt;/code&gt; like above. It renders like
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;link rel='stylesheet' id='style-css'  href='http://local.xyz.com/wp-content/themes/customizr-child/style.css?ver=1.0' type='text/css' media='all' /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
that fitler has to fully replace title. It was good, if there was ability to :
1) get title after that function defines title (who know, maybe I only want to change small part of title, after finally declaring the title)
2) ON/OFF automatic &lt;code&gt;echo&lt;/code&gt; output.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
however, thanks./

&lt;code&gt;wp_get_document_title()&lt;/code&gt; has some hooks, but not full ability to modify full title thought
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That function has the &lt;code&gt;pre_get_document_title&lt;/code&gt; filter which allows you to short-circuit the complete output.

by default, &lt;code&gt;_wp_render_title_tag&lt;/code&gt; function is hooked in &lt;code&gt;wp_head, 1&lt;/code&gt;  (in &lt;code&gt;wp-includes\general-template.php&lt;/code&gt;):
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;function _wp_render_title_tag() {
    ....
    echo '&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;' . wp_get_document_title() . '&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;' . "\n";
}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
it leaves us no chance to modify, filter ... the title... (although &lt;code&gt;wp_get_document_title&lt;/code&gt; has some hooks, but not full ability to modify full title thought),
it explicitly echoes the title....  instead, we should have filters,like this:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wiki-code"&gt;&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;function _wp_render_title_tag() {
    ....
    $title =  '&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;' .  apply_filters('render_title_tag', wp_get_document_title() ) . '&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;' . "\n";
    $echo = apply_filters('echo_render_title_tag', true);
    if ($echo) {     echo $title;    }
    else {     return $title;    }
}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Hi @pothi,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This ticket is related to core WordPress codes,
I don't use any plugins for testing this issue,
You can check this issue by creating a simple child theme,
That is not related to the child theme itself
This is how core WordPress loads the style.css of child theme automatically
And it attach wrong version to loaded style.css of child theme
You can create a simple child theme using this guide and check it: &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;Child_Themes&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

How did you create the child theme?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
By default, WordPress comes bundled with a few default themes, such as Twenty Fifteen, but not child theme/s.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Did you use any plugin? If yes, please post your concern in the relevant plugin support forum. You may know more at &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://wordpress.org/support/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://wordpress.org/support/&lt;/a&gt; .

A bit of discussion in the WordPress.com forums is also happening:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://en.forums.wordpress.com/topic/link-gallery-images-to-pages-and-or-posts-or-external-url?replies=107"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://en.forums.wordpress.com/topic/link-gallery-images-to-pages-and-or-posts-or-external-url?replies=107&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
107 replies so far since 2013.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Any chance of this seeing the light of day this year?

Hi,
Looking at the code I found a little error on wp-admin/includes/class-wp-list-table.php. The $pagination_links_class variable should add a hide-if-js at line 848, but instead of adding the class at the existing variable it clears the previus class.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Is there a change for update on this? Global PHP 5.2 usage dropped from 8.3% to 5.5% over the past 10 months. I assume you sadly still consider it too much to take any actions but can we know PHP 5.2 usage by current WordPress versions?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Codex says that the only officially supported version is WordPress 4.7.1, but I assume it might give us biased view on that. So maybe from WordPress 4.5 onwards? @dd32: you shared some pretty interesting data. Any chance on getting those for March 2017?
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;i&gt;Milestone&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
@jnylen0 Moving this to 4.7.3 to be sure it gets bumped before the point ships so new installs won't have an instant upgrade notification. With the new release cycle, I'm not sure if we want to bump for point releases or only majors. Thoughts?
&lt;/p&gt;

Akismet 3.3 has been released, so the svn external needs to be bumped to &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/1602266/akismet"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/1602266/akismet&lt;/a&gt;

I'll reopen this ticket throughout the 4.7.x &amp;amp; 4.8 cycle to track any additional releases.

      <description>invalid: &lt;p&gt;
Welcome @alirizwan17
Although what you describe may feel annoying, we can't really do anything about your ticket here, for several reasons:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;You don't give enough information to even have the slightest chance of re-creating the problem. (It's not even clear if you actually were visiting a blog on wordpress.com, rather than some blog with a totally different URL, which is using the wordpress.org framework.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The kind of behavior you mention here is not a part of the wordpress.org core functionality. If there's a bug here, then it is most probably located in one of the plugins that the blog owner uses. (Then a bug should be reported to the developer of that plugin.)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In some situations, this kind of problem may also happen, for instance, if your browser is blocking javascript or cookies.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So for the moment, there is not much to do here. If you still happen to know that this for sure is a bug in wordpress.org core, then you should reopen this ticket and provide more information.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
wp-list.js is used for &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; list tables in WordPress, but not all. We should switch everything it does over to the REST API, and simultaneously rethink list tables to ensure consistency.
&lt;/p&gt;

Hi @SergeyBiryukov ,
I didn't use wp_enqueue_style() or any other functions to load the child style,
WordPress loads the child style.css automatically
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

      <pubDate>Wed, 01 Mar 2017 02:47:54 GMT</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;i&gt;Keywords&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Status&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Owner&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
@westonruter it looks like zooming isn't a good way to test it in the browser you're using since it's not scaling the text. I'm adding a screencast of what it looks like to me (and how I would expect this to actually work on larger screens).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The intent is to grow proportionally from 300px to 600px on screens larger than 1600px, maintaining the proportions currently found on a 1600px screen. The width is capped at 600px to align with the 600px maximum pane width on smaller screens so that there are no changes necessary in how the pane's contents are currently displayed. In other words, the range of sizes currently used in core would still be used, but they are used on very large screens where extra space is available in addition to being used on very small screens where the pane fills the whole screen.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The primary reason that a slider approach doesn't make sense yet is that the contents of the customize pane do not take advantage of the extra space in most cases. Therefore, there isn't enough of a benefit for it to add extra complexity to the interface. This will likely change substantially with the planned longer-term changes, but this is the best approach for now.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here's a summary of the pane sizes at different screen sizes with the patch:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Screens less than 600px wide: full screen width (0 - 600px)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Screens 601px - 1666px wide: 300px
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Screens 1667px - 3332px wide: linearly interpolated between 300px and 600px (18%)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Screens larger than 3333px wide: 600px
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
These values are chosen to ensure that the preview realistically represents the site's layout (considering fluid and responsive designs) at the current screen size, while also maximizing the width of the customize controls pane to the extent that there are benefits to it being wider.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
So it seems there is 2 components to this. One is to actually fix the &lt;code&gt;switch_theme&lt;/code&gt; method and the other one is to be able to fix the customizer theme preview since it changes options at runtime and isn't calling &lt;code&gt;switch_theme()&lt;/code&gt; until the user clicks save &amp;amp; activate.
&lt;/p&gt;

In looking at the method &lt;code&gt;test_utf8mb3_post_saves_with_emoji()&lt;/code&gt; in the file &lt;code&gt;tests/phpunit/tests/post.php&lt;/code&gt;, I noticed an instantiation of the &lt;code&gt;wpdb_exposed_methods_for_testing&lt;/code&gt; class. However, it doesn't seem like this test calls any non-public methods of the &lt;code&gt;wpdb&lt;/code&gt; class. It seems like using this special class isn't necessary. Am I missing something?
&lt;/p&gt;

If we apply the same logic for templates, we are essentially saying that clients can set any arbitrary data (or just an arbitrary PHP filename) in this field, which doesn't seem right.  Instead, I think the change we should make here is to enable setting a post to the same &lt;code&gt;template&lt;/code&gt; value that it currently has - this should be a no-op even if the current theme doesn't support that value.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I agree with this - There doesn't appear to be any value in allowing it to be set to a value which isn't supported by the theme - as it's theme-specific data (unlike post formats), however we shouldn't force a client to wipe out the existing value in order to resave a post.
@danielbachhuber If you've got a use-case, I'd love to hear it
&lt;/p&gt;

This is pretty different than post formats - the current theme may not support all formats, but there is still a finite list of possibly supported formats.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don't have any specific concerns with exposing this new information either, but my first thought was to restrict it since it's not really available elsewhere.  Unless someone disagrees with the approach here, we'll get it committed after the 4.7.3 release ships.
&lt;/p&gt;

A stop-gap using javascript, good while the &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; tag id remains "reg_passmail":
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="wiki"&gt;add_action('login_footer', 'add_reg_passmsg');
function add_reg_passmsg(){ ?&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;script type="text/javascript"&amp;gt;document.getElementById("reg_passmail").innerHTML = "Log in info will be sent via email and a link via text.";
&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;?php }

      <title>Ticket #39909 (Make title behaviours consistent across all widgets on first load) updated</title>

      <description>&lt;i&gt;Milestone&lt;/i&gt; changed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
@karmatosed what do you think about updating each widget to have a &lt;code&gt;placeholder&lt;/code&gt; in each of their “Title” inputs if there is a default title that gets rendered in the preview? This would be a quick win.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="citation"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Another example, the Calendar widget has no title and compared to the examples above this feels weird. What I think should happen is that the same title behaviour occurs for all widgets when you first load them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In this case the &lt;code&gt;placeholder&lt;/code&gt; would probably have to remain absent from the calendar widget, since there is no default widget heading. I don't think we'd be able to start introducing “Calendar” as a default widget title as this would be a backwards-incompatible change, such as for users who may be expecting the calendar widget to not have a heading when none is supplied. Does that make sense?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Aside: Placeholders were implemented for core widgets in the &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/js-widgets/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;JS Widgets&lt;/a&gt; feature plugin.
&lt;/p&gt;

Hi @parsmizban, welcome to WordPress Trac! Thanks for the ticket.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It looks like you're not passing the version argument to &lt;a class="ext-link" href="https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_enqueue_style/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;wp_enqueue_style()&lt;/a&gt;, so the WordPress core version is appended by default.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Could you share the lines of code where you're calling &lt;code&gt;wp_enqueue_style()&lt;/code&gt;?
&lt;/p&gt;
